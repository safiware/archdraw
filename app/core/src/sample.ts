// "Bean There", the sample project the tour teaches on. It is a real git project (a local repo and its own "origin"),
// built from the bundled files every time the tour starts, so everything in it is real — the canvas, the editor, the
// waiting update and its colored diff, Approve — except the agent's replies, which are scripted and say so, and the
// hourly sync, which is off. Nothing about it reaches GitHub or an AI provider.
