// The user's AI keys on the desktop: encrypted with the OS keychain through Electron's safeStorage (Keychain on macOS,
// Secret Service / KWallet on Linux, DPAPI on Windows), in a 0600 file in userData. On a Linux desktop with no keyring,
// safeStorage falls back to a hard-coded password ("basic_text"); `weak` says so, and the app tells the user.
// On macOS the keychain is opened only when a key is saved or a stored one is read: any safeStorage call, even
// isEncryptionAvailable(), makes macOS ask for the login password ("archdraw Safe Storage"), and a user who never
// stores a key should never see that.
// Keys set in the environment (OPENAI_API_KEY, ...) are used when none is stored.
