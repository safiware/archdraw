# Syntax reference — 0.16.0

What the language accepts. The parser, resolver and SVG renderer implement all of it; the sections at the end record what is defective, unchecked or undecided.

The worked example is `examples/arch.reladraw`, transcribed from the reference render beside it. Nearly every construct here exists because that diagram demanded it. The exception is non-overlap, which that diagram never triggers, so `examples/separation.reladraw` covers it instead.

## Shape of the file

A statement starts at the beginning of a line. A long one may continue onto the lines after it by indenting them:

```
node desktop1 "Desktop 1 / Linux"
  above-left of hub  gap: tight
  badge: desktop  style: synced
```

A line that starts with whitespace continues the statement above it, and a blank line or the next unindented line ends it. How much whitespace makes no difference — one space and a tab mean the same — so nothing can depend on indentation you cannot see. None after a key's colon is an amount too: `gap:tight` is `gap: tight`. A bracket may stay open across lines, as in `line: (color: red,` with `pattern: dashed)` on the next. There are no blocks: indentation continues a statement, and never puts one thing inside another.

An indented line with no statement to continue — at the top of the file, or after a blank line or an unindented comment — is an error rather than a statement of its own, and so is an indented line starting with a statement keyword such as `node`. Both are almost always a stray indent, and both say to remove it.

Blank lines and `//` comments are ignored. A comment runs to the end of the line and may trail a statement, so `node a "Docker"  // the one that matters` is fine. An indented comment line sits inside the statement it follows; an unindented one ends it.

A lone `/` is an ordinary character rather than the start of a comment, and `#` is ordinary too — it opens a hex color. Comments were spelled `#` in an earlier version and moved to `//` so that `fill: #14532d` could be written the way every other tool writes a color.

A statement is a positional head — the keyword, a name and a text — followed by attributes and placements in any order. A token ending in a colon opens an attribute and nothing else does, so the two never have to be told apart by position.

```
node server "Home Server" left of cluster  gap: wide  badge: desktop
     ^      ^             ^                ^
     |      |             |                attributes
     |      |             a placement
     |      text
     name
```

`node aside "…"  shape: none  below dumps (gap: tight)  overlap: allow` is one statement with a placement in the middle of its attributes, and reads the same as any other arrangement of those three. Until 0.3.0 placements had to come first; that rule existed only because a bare `gap:` between two placements could not be told from the node-wide default, and [bracketing a gap onto its placement](#a-gap-belongs-to-the-placement) removed the ambiguity that made it necessary.

Attribute values are a single bare word unless quoted. No commas between attributes.

## Nodes

```
node <name> ["<text>" [(<text properties>)]] [<placement> | <attribute>] ...
```

`name` identifies the node and must be unique. It may not contain `:`, which would make it a key, or `;`, which is reserved. `text` is what appears inside it, with ` / ` — a slash with whitespace on both sides — marking a line break.

The text is optional, and a node without it takes its own name as its text:

```
node parser
node resolver  right of parser
```

draws two nodes reading "parser" and "resolver". A dotted name shows its last segment only — `node server.docker` reads "docker", because the containment is already drawn and repeating it in the text says nothing new.

Write `""` for a node that is deliberately blank: an invisible container, a node that is nothing but its badge. The empty string is the way to say a node has no text, and leaving the text out entirely is the way to say the name is the text. A node drawn as a picture is the one exception — there, leaving the text out means no text, and `""` says the same thing.

A name written this way is doing two jobs, so renaming such a node changes the picture. That is the trade, and the escape from it is to state the text.

The whitespace is part of the marker, not decoration. A slash inside a word is an ordinary character, so `TCP/IP`, `16/9`, `I/O` and `https://example.com/x` all render as written. An earlier version broke on every `/` and quietly tore those texts in half.

For a text that wants a spaced slash and no break, `\/` escapes it: `"Before \/ After"` is one line. The escapes are `\"`, `\\`, `\/` and `\[`.

Everything else a text has to say about itself it says in brackets after it — see "The text and its brackets" below.

Containment is a dotted name. A node named `server.docker` is inside `server`. The parent must be declared before the child.

```
node server         "Home Server"  left of cluster
node server.mirror  "shared folder / mirror"
node server.deploy  "deploy dir"
```

A container is sized by its contents. Children stack vertically in written order unless a child carries a placement of its own.

A container with empty text and no fill or border takes up no room of its own and draws nothing. It exists so that everything inside it can be placed against as a single shape:

```
style invisible  fill: none  border: none

node cluster ""  style: invisible
node cluster.hub       "Cloud sync"
node cluster.desktop1  "Desktop 1"  above-left of cluster.hub

node server "Home Server"  left of cluster
```

Here the server clears the whole cluster. Placed `left of cluster.hub` instead, it would only clear the hub, and the machines around the hub would be free to grow into it.

A container's text can say where in the node it goes — see "The text and its brackets" below.

### How the contents sit

A container is as wide as the wider of its title and its contents. When the title wins there is slack, and every child sits at the smallest position its constraints allow — so all of it ends up on the right and the column reads as ragged inside a node whose own text may well be centered. `contents:` is what says otherwise:

```
node svc "Ingestion and enrichment pipeline"  contents: (widths: match, align: center)
```

`widths:` sizes the children and `align:` positions the block of them. They are independent, and the bracket is what keeps the levels apart: `contents:` is a property of the node, `widths:` a property of the contents.

| written | means |
|---|---|
| nothing | natural widths, ranged left |
| `contents: (widths: match)` | every child as wide as the widest, ranged left |
| `contents: (widths: fill)` | every child spans the whole content band; `align` then has no slack to work in. A single column only: children side by side cannot all be the full width, and are refused by name |
| `contents: (align: center)` | natural widths, the block of them centered |
| `contents: (widths: match, align: center)` | the tidy centered column |

`align:` takes `left`, `center` and `right` here, the same three words it takes in a text's brackets. Widths are the only thing `widths:` touches and position the only thing `align:` touches; neither reaches a child's own contents.

**Changed 2026-09-20.** This replaced `align: widths`, which is now an error naming its substitution. That key was a size operation wearing an alignment's name, and its value set had one member — a flag in a property's clothes. With it gone, `align` means one thing everywhere in the language: how a block's lines or children range against each other.

### The text and its brackets

Everything a text says about itself rides in brackets after it. The keys are `color`, `size`, `wrap`, `align` and `at`, in any order, with the comma optional punctuation:

```
node docker "Docker" (at: bottom-center, align: center)  below deploy
node aside "Written by a nightly cron job." (size: small, wrap: 30)  shape: none
```

They are bracketed onto the text rather than written among the node's attributes for the same reason [a gap is bracketed onto its placement](#a-gap-belongs-to-the-placement): they modify that one thing, and the brackets make the scope visible instead of leaving it to be inferred from what happens to sit nearby. What is left at the top level is then about the node — its body, its color, where it goes.

An edge's text takes the same brackets, less `at`: a node's text sits somewhere in a box and an edge's rides at the middle of its line, so there is no position to name.

```
edge a -> b  "rclone" (color: theme-muted, size: small)
```

A **style** has no text of its own for a bracket to hang off, so it hangs the bracket off a key instead:

```
style aside  text: (size: small, color: theme-muted)
```

Bundling a text's properties into a style is how they come to mean something: `style aside` applied to several nodes says those are the same kind of remark, which `(size: small)` written out at each of them does not.

`color` takes a color written as the viewer will receive it — `#8b8b8b`, or any CSS color — or a theme color such as `theme-muted`, the theme's secondary text color, which survives a change of theme. See "Theme colors".

`size: small | normal | large` sets how big the text is set, and so does a plain number of pixels, `size: 22`. The names are the default and the preferred form: they follow the document's size if it is ever set differently, where `22` stays 22. A number says nothing about *why* one text is bigger than another, so bundle it into a style that does. `14px` is refused, since the number is already in pixels, and so is zero or less. Every kind of text has a default and `size` overrides it, exactly as `fill:` overrides the theme's color; only `shape: none` defaults to anything but `normal`, and it defaults to `small`.

`wrap: <n>` folds the text at word boundaries every `n` characters, on top of whatever ` / ` already breaks. It is how you make a block of text narrow and tall so it can sit snugly beside something, rather than wide and short so it cannot. The number is a count of characters and not a distance: it says how much fits on a line and nothing about where anything sits.

`at: <position>` is where the block of text sits in the node, named from [the nine positions](#against-a-part-of-a-node) — `top-left`, `bottom-center`, `center` and the rest. In a container the vertical half of the word says which end of the node the text's band is at, and the contents take the other end; a container whose text names neither end is an error, since there would be no other end left for the contents. The default is `top-left` in a container and `center` in a leaf.

`align: left | center | right` is a different question and stays one: it says how the block's own *lines* range against each other, which matters whenever they are of unequal length and is not the same as where the block is. Its default is `left` in a container and `center` in a leaf.

Where the node is exactly the size of what it holds — which is most leaves, since a leaf is sized from its own text — there is no slack and `at` changes nothing. It bites where there is some: an icon placed `inside <node> right` is two lines tall, so a one-line text beside it has room to sit at either end of. A badge does not give it that room, because a badge is placed against the text and goes wherever the text goes.

#### Markup in a text

A word or a stretch of a text can borrow the look of a style:

```
style dim  text: (color: theme-muted)

node pc.files "shared folder / [dim]synced[/dim]"
```

The opener names a **style**, never a color, so the marked words borrow a meaning the file already has instead of restating a value that goes stale the day the thing it means is recolored. A style that says nothing about text is an error naming the missing part, and so is a name no style answers to.

The closer repeats the name. `[/dim]`, not `[/]` — a reader should never have to count openers, and a mismatched close is then refused by name. Marks do not nest.

A mark may cross a line break or a fold, so `"[dim]placement is / an output[/dim]"` quiets both lines. That is what it buys over the `subtext:` it replaced, which could only quiet everything after the first line and did it by counting, in a style somewhere else in the file, where a reader of the text could not see it.

`[` opens a mark, so a literal one is written `\[`:

```
node sizes "sizes \[small, normal, large]"  shape: none
```

### The body

Every node has a *body*: the thing that is drawn where the node is. Two keys name it, and each names one part.

`shape: <name>` is the outline the node is drawn with.

| Value | What it draws |
| --- | --- |
| `rectangle` | The plain rounded box. The default, so nothing has to say it. |
| `document` | The same box with its top-right corner folded — the flowchart symbol saying *this is an artifact, not a process*. |
| `circle` | A circle just big enough to hold the text, and always round — a longer text makes a bigger circle, never an oval. |
| `none` | No outline, no fill, no padding. The node is its text and nothing else. |

`icon: <name>` is a picture the node is drawn **as**, with no box at all.

| Name | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| `disk` | A physical drive — the hardware, not the filesystem on it. |
| `desktop` | A workstation. |
| `laptop` | A portable machine. |
| `package` | Something stored as a whole rather than run: an archive, a bucket, a sync root. |
| `cubes` | Several interchangeable units of the same kind. |
| `cube` | One of them. |
| `database` | A store queried rather than read as files. |

```
node dump "db dump / (app 1)"  shape: document
node aside "Written by a nightly cron job." (wrap: 30)  shape: none
node svc  icon: cube
```

A node has one body, so writing both keys is an error naming both.

The `document` fold is worth having because a shape is a second channel alongside color, and a stronger one. A fill means whatever you assigned it and a reader has to learn it from the diagram; a folded corner has meant "a document" for as long as there have been flowcharts, and reads with no legend. Most diagrams lose the difference between a thing that runs and a thing that is produced, because every node is a rectangle. `diamond` will join these when a diagram asks for one.

A circle is an ordinary node in every other way, and the file means the same thing whichever shape its nodes are. `from: right` on a circle leaves from its rightmost point, and several edges on one side spread round the quarter of the circle about that point, each meeting it square on. A corner such as `top-right` is the point on the circle halfway between those two sides, not the corner of the square around it. A circle can hold other nodes; they sit in the middle of it. A circle cannot yet take a `badge:`, a `deck:`, or a node placed against its own edge or text, and each is refused with an error saying so.

`circle` is the one name that describes the picture rather than the meaning, because a circle has no single meaning to name it after: it is a state in one diagram, a step in another, a person in a third.

A name says what the thing *is*, never what the picture looks like: naming the meaning is what lets the drawing be improved later without every diagram that uses it changing sense. `document`, not `folded-corner`. The one place that rule stops is a picture with no single meaning — the cube stands for a container in one diagram, a VM in another, a service in a third — which is why it is called `cube` and not `instance`. An unrecognized name is an error listing the whole set, rather than a node that quietly draws nothing.

The icon set is small on purpose, and it is not the trade a drawing tool makes. There you pick a shape out of a visual palette and hundreds are browsable; here you type the word from memory, which caps the useful vocabulary at what fits in a head. A picture outside it is one you declare yourself — see [Your own icons](#your-own-icons).

`cubes` draws three whatever the number, because it is the symbol for "several" and not a count. Where the number matters — where one of them is the end of an arrow — they are separate nodes, each with `icon: cube`.

A node drawn as a picture is an ordinary node in every other way. It takes placements, it takes edges and sides, other nodes keep clear of it. A [badge](#badges) is one of these, written for you beside a node's text. It cannot contain anything, though, and a picture with children is an error, as is a `shape: none` node with children — neither has a box for anything to go inside.

**A picture with no text of its own shows none.** Everywhere else a node with no text is labelled with its name, because `node a` and `node b right of a` mean the two boxes to read "a" and "b". A picture usually *is* the statement, so the default flips: `node svc icon: cube` draws the cube and no caption, and a row of five of them does not come out reading a, b, c, d, e. Write the text if you want one.

The built-in icons are drawn from path data inside the tool, never from a font or a linked file. The output is a standalone SVG and has to stay one — an icon font renders as blank boxes on a machine that does not have it, and a linked image has to travel beside the file.

### Badges

`badge: <name>` puts one of the same pictures beside the node's text, as a small mark on a node that keeps its own body.

```
node drive "External HD"  badge: disk
```

**`badge:` is a shorthand, and this is what it stands for:**

```
node drive "External HD"
node drive.badge  icon: disk  right of drive text
```

A child drawn as a picture, placed beside its parent's text. Everything a badge does follows from that line and from the rules for [a child against its own parent](#against-its-own-parent) — there is no rule of its own:

- The node grows to hold the text and the badge side by side, because a node grows to hold its children.
- On a leaf the text and the badge center in the box as one group. On a container the badge sits beside the title in the band, and the band is as tall as the two together.
- The picture is two lines of the node's text tall, so it follows `(size: …)` down and up with the text.
- With no text at all — `node flag "" badge: disk` — the badge sits where the text would have been, with no gap beside it, so the node is exactly the badge and its padding. That makes a badge usable as a marker and not only as a title-block ornament.
- A text sent to one end with `at:` does not take the badge with it. A leaf is as tall as the badge, the badge is centered on the text, and so the text sits in the middle. To give a text room to move, put the picture against a side instead — see `at:` under [The text and its brackets](#the-text-and-its-brackets).

The child is called `<node>.badge` and can be named like any other: `below drive.badge`, or an edge to it. Declaring your own `drive.badge` beside a `badge:` is an error naming both ways out. Something else placed `right of drive text` is placed exactly as the badge is, so the two form [one list](#several-nodes-saying-the-same-thing), badge first.

A badge in the far corner of a container is not what the shorthand says. Write the child yourself, `node drive.mark icon: disk inside drive top-right`.

**A badge decorates a node; `icon:` replaces its body.** The test is whether the node still sizes itself from its text: a badged node does, a picture does not. The same artwork serves both. Only a box can wear a badge. On a picture or a `shape: none` node the word is an error, since neither has a box to grow around it.

`badge` is appearance, so a style can carry one and every store in a diagram then looks alike without the word being written more than once:

```
style store  fill: #142814  border: #486544  badge: database
node records "Records"  style: store
```

### Your own icons

`icon <name>` declares a picture of your own, and from then on `icon: <name>` and `badge: <name>` use it exactly as they would a built-in one. The picture is SVG, pasted between `"""` marks or read from a file:

```
icon crate """
<svg viewBox="0 0 24 24">
  <path d="M3 7 L12 3 L21 7 L21 17 L12 21 L3 17 Z" fill="none" stroke="currentColor"/>
</svg>
"""

icon rack "./rack.svg"

node store "Warehouse"  badge: crate
node servers  icon: rack  right of store
```

Between `"""` marks everything is taken as written, double quotes and line breaks included, so an SVG can be pasted in unchanged. The opening `"""` may start the next line rather than end the `icon` line. A `"""` string is accepted only in an `icon` declaration for now.

A file is found relative to the diagram's own file. Only the command-line tool can read one; in the playground or a web page, paste the SVG instead.

- **It keeps its own colors.** A pasted drawing looks the same on every theme. What it leaves to `currentColor` takes the theme's icon color, which is how a one-color icon follows the theme.
- **It is fitted to the icon's square,** in proportion and centered, by its `viewBox`. With no `viewBox`, its `width` and `height` stand in; with neither it is refused, since nothing says how big the drawing is.
- **Its ids and class names are renamed** on the way in, so two icons that both call a gradient `a` don't pick up each other's.
- **Script is refused:** a `<script>` element or an `on…` attribute.

An icon of your own with a built-in's name replaces the built-in throughout the diagram, so `icon disk "./my-disk.svg"` redraws every disk. Declaring one name twice is an error.

The drawing is written into the output, so the SVG stays standalone however the icon was supplied.

## Placement

A *placement* says one thing about where a node goes. A node carries as many as it needs.

```
above X           below X           left of X         right of X
above-left of X   above-right of X  below-left of X   below-right of X
level with X      top level with X  bottom level with X
                  left level with X  right level with X
```

Any of them may name more than one target — `right of borg and bare`, `level with borg, bare and media`. See [Several targets at once](#several-targets-at-once).

`of` is optional after any direction, so `below X` and `below of X` both parse. Write whichever reads as English.

There are no coordinates. Each direction leaves a gap, one of `none`, `tight`, `normal` (the default) and `wide`, or a plain number of pixels — `gap: 12`. Prefer the names: change what `tight` means and every tight gap follows. A number is for the distance you actually mean, and it is no less relative than a name, since it is still measured from the target. Write it in brackets on the placement itself, or as `gap:` on a node to set the default for every relationship that node is in — including the ones named against it. See [A gap belongs to the placement](#a-gap-belongs-to-the-placement).

Exactly one node in the document may be left unplaced. Everything else is positioned, directly or transitively, relative to it.

### How placements combine

**A gap sets a minimum distance rather than an exact one,** so everything ends up as close together as your placements allow.

That single rule is what makes a corridor work. Say two things sit side by side, then put a third between them:

```
node hub    "Hub"
node side   "Side"    left of hub
node wedge  "Wedged"  right of side  left of hub  level with hub
```

Nothing states how far apart `hub` and `side` are. They start one gap apart, and adding `wedge` between them pushes them to exactly `wedge`'s width plus two gaps. Delete `wedge` and they close back up. You never pick a number, and no number goes stale when a text grows.

This is the step you would otherwise do by hand: shove two things apart to make room, then drag everything back together so the diagram isn't full of holes. The file states the relationships and the distances fall out.

**A lone directional placement still sets both axes.** `right of docker` on its own also centers the node vertically on Docker, because walking right from something keeps you on its center line. That half is dropped as soon as another placement binds the axis, so it never fights anything you wrote.

**Two placements on one axis and nothing on the other is an error.** `right of docker  left of macbook` with no vertical placement would have to choose between Docker's center line and the Macbook's, and that choice decides which row of the diagram the node shares. The tool refuses and names the axis you left unstated. Add `level with docker`, or `below` something, and it resolves.

**Placements that cannot all hold are an error naming them,** rather than a picture with one node on top of another. Because gaps are minimums, this only happens when something is pinned exactly — by `level with`, or by a loop of placements that each demand more room than the last.

`level with X` is the one placement that fixes a distance outright: share a center line, no gap involved. It binds the vertical only.

```
node dumps ""  right of server.docker  left of cluster  level with server.docker
```

Horizontally between two different targets, vertically level with a third. No single relation can say that, which is why a node can carry several.

Naming a side in front of it aligns that side instead of the center. `top level with media` puts the node's top side on the media node's top side; `bottom`, `left` and `right` work the same way. `top` and `bottom` bind the vertical, `left` and `right` the horizontal — so `left level with X` and `left of X` are different statements, and the word after `left` is what tells them apart.

### Several targets at once

A placement may name several targets joined by `and`, with optional commas. It then places the node against the box that just bounds them all — a region you never have to declare.

```
node swapped "Swapped weekly …"  shape: none  left of drive.mirror and drive.clone  gap: tight
node kept    "never rotated …"   shape: none  right of drive.archive and drive.old  gap: tight
```

Neither annotation says anything about its own vertical position, and neither needs to. A lone directional placement centers on what it names, and what these name is the region covering two nodes, so each one lands centered on the pair it explains.

This is why it is one placement with two targets rather than two placements. Two separate `level with` statements are two demands that both have to hold, and nodes at different heights cannot both share a center line with the same node, so that combination is a contradiction. One statement naming two targets is a single demand about a single region.

Combined with the rule that a lone directional placement also binds the other axis, this is how you offset one row against another. `below a and b` reads as "under the pair, centered between them", because the direction binds the vertical against the region and the horizontal falls on the region's center line:

```
node a  icon: cube
node b  right of a  gap: tight  icon: cube
node c  right of b  gap: tight  icon: cube
node d  below a and b  gap: tight  icon: cube
node e  below b and c  gap: tight  icon: cube
```

Three above, two below, each sitting in the gap between two of them. Adding a second placement to bind the horizontal is what would left-justify the lower row instead — the centering is dropped as soon as anything else claims that axis.

For a direction the region is a floor, so `right of one and three` clears whichever of them sticks out furthest, and it works wherever the targets sit. For an alignment the region is an exact position, and there is one restriction worth knowing: it must not depend on the node being aligned to it. Aligning a node to the region covering `A` and `B` while `B` is placed relative to that same node is refused by name, because there is no order in which each could wait for the other.

### A gap belongs to the placement

A gap is a fact about a relationship, not about a node, so it is written on the placement that names that relationship:

```
node dumps ""  right of server.docker  left of machines (gap: wide)  level with server.docker
```

The dumps come straight out of Docker, so they sit at the default distance from it; the two curves on the other side need room to fan out before they reach the machines, so that gap is wide. One number could not say both.

`gap:` written as an ordinary attribute still works and is the node's default, used by every placement that does not name its own:

```
node stack "Stack"  below wedge  right of wall (gap: tight)  gap: wide
```

Wide below the wedge, tight to the right of the wall.

**A node's `gap:` reaches every relationship it is in, not only the ones it wrote down.** A relationship exists regardless of which of its two ends happened to name the other, so `gap:` on a node also applies to placements written *against* it:

```
node parser "Parser"  gap: wide
node renderer "Renderer"  right of parser
```

`parser` names nothing, and the gap still opens. Without this, the only way to push those two apart would be to know that `renderer` is the one that mentioned `parser` and to edit that line instead — which is a fact about how the file was typed, not about the picture.

Where both ends state a gap the larger applies, since a gap is a minimum either way. A gap in brackets is not a default and is not overruled: it is the specific statement about that one pair, so it wins outright. If you mean a gap to govern one placement and not the whole node, that is what the brackets are for.

The brackets take `gap:` and nothing else at present; anything else in them is an error naming it. An alignment is an error too — `level with x (gap: tight)` — because sharing a line leaves no distance for a gap to set, and a word that quietly does nothing looks like a fault in the tool.

### On a box

A placement's target may be a *part* of a node rather than the whole of it — `inside hub top-right`, `right of hub text`, `on hub bottom-left`. That is where `inside`, `outside` and `on` come in, and it has a section of its own: [Against a part of a node](#against-a-part-of-a-node).

### Side to side

A zero gap turns an offset into contact. `below docker (gap: none)` puts the node's top side flat against Docker's bottom side, so exact side relations need no vocabulary of their own.

### Targets

The target of a placement may be a child of another container. `right of server.docker` places a top-level node against something nested. Containers scope names; they do not scope placement.

Every axis is solved as one system, so a target does not have to come first. What cannot be satisfied is a loop of placements each demanding more room than the last, and that is an error naming the placements in it.

## Nodes do not overlap

You never have to say that two nodes must not sit on top of each other. Every pair carries that already, and `overlap: allow` on either one is the opt-out for the rare case where one is meant to cover another. A container never counts as overlapping its own contents, and neither does a node placed `inside` or `on` a part of another and the box it is stamped on — naming a part and saying `inside` is the author stating the overlap, so there is nothing to report. That exemption is for the pair and nothing else, so the node is still kept clear of everything else in the drawing.

**The tool never picks which way to separate two nodes.** It reads the direction off the arrangement you already stated. Say `A` is left of `B`, put `x` between them, and hang a wide node below `x`: because `x` is right of `A` and the wide node is centered under `x`, the file lets the wide node travel rightward away from `A` and offers no way back. So the only separation it allows is `A` moving further left. Nothing is chosen. Where nothing in the file orders a pair on either axis, the tool refuses and names the pair rather than guessing — which is what happens if you hang two nodes off the same side of the same target and expect them to sort themselves out.

**One place the tool decides something you didn't write.** Sometimes both axes already imply an order. The wide node is rightward of `A` and also below it, so the overlap clears either by pushing `A` and `B` apart or by dropping the wide node lower, and both satisfy everything you wrote. The rule is to **separate along the axis where the two nodes overlap least**, which is also the smallest movement, and which matches what a person does by hand.

If you want that pinned down rather than defaulted, group the nodes: put `x` and the wide node in an invisible container. The container becomes the thing that must not overlap `A` and `B`, and it moves as one.

Separation leaves a tight gap, deliberately small — enough to read as two nodes rather than one, never enough to look like a distance somebody asked for. Say `gap:` if you want breathing room there. Between two things inside one box it leaves the step the box's contents are stacked by instead, since that is the spacing everything else in there has.

## Edges

```
edge <from> <arrow> <to> ["<text>"] [between <a> and <b> [vertically|horizontally]] [attributes]
```

```
edge a -> b       // an arrow at b
edge a <- b       // an arrow at a
edge a <-> b      // one at each end
edge a -- b       // a plain line
```

`a <- b` draws the same picture as `b -> a`. What changes is which name you write first, and that is worth having: the first name reads as the subject of the line, and plenty of edges are about the thing the arrow points at rather than the thing it leaves. **`from:` and `to:` follow the writing order**, never the arrow: `from:` is always the first name's side and `to:` the second's, whichever way the arrow points.

### What is drawn at each end

The arrow is a mark, a line, a mark. The line is `-` or `--`, the two meaning the same, and either mark may be left off. A mark is a word, or a glyph that stands for one:

| mark | draws | glyph |
|---|---|---|
| `arrow` | a filled arrowhead | `>` at the right end, `<` at the left |
| `oarrow` | an outlined arrowhead | `\|>` at the right end, `<\|` at the left |
| `dot` | a filled circle | `*` |
| `odot` | an outlined circle | `o` |
| `diamond` | a filled diamond | |
| `odiamond` | an outlined diamond | |
| `bar` | a stroke across the line | `\|` |
| `none` | nothing | |

The `o` in front means outlined, for every shape. A glyph that points is spelled the way it points, which is why `<->` reads as it does. So these are all the same arrow, and you write whichever reads best to you:

```
edge a o--> b
edge a odot--arrow b
edge a (odot)--(arrow) b
edge a [odot] -- [arrow] b
```

A mark touches the dashes or is in brackets. `edge a -- dot b` is an error, because it reads just as well as a plain line to a node named `dot`.

**Marks as attributes.** `from-mark:` and `to-mark:` say the same thing, one end at a time, and they are how a style carries marks:

```
style inherits  to-mark: oarrow
edge dog -- animal  style: inherits
edge cat -- animal  style: inherits
```

**An end with nothing written is left open, not empty.** `dog -- animal` is plain until something says otherwise, and here the style does. `none` is the word for "nothing at this end, whatever the style says": `edge a none--> b`, or `from-mark: none`.

**A mark written in the arrow is final.** The edge's own `to-mark:` may repeat it but not contradict it — `edge a --> b  to-mark: dot` is an error, since both halves are on one line and one of them would be dead text. A style fills only the ends the arrow leaves open: a style giving every end a `bar`, applied to `a --> b`, draws a bar at `a` and still the arrow at `b`.

Endpoints may be nested (`desktop1.files`). An edge never says where a node goes and routing is the renderer's problem, with one exception: an edge with text claims room in the gap it crosses, which is the next section.

An edge's text breaks on ` / ` exactly as a node's does, and the block centers on the point the text would otherwise have occupied, so ``"run `deploy` / shell command"`` stacks its two lines around the midpoint of the line rather than running off along it. An edge's text takes the same brackets a node's does, less `at`, so `(wrap: 20)` folds it and `(color: theme-muted)` quiets it.

### A text makes room for itself

Putting something between two nodes is what pushes them apart, and a text drawn in a corridor is something in that corridor. So an edge with text widens the gap it crosses by what its text needs — the text, a run of line either side of it, and the arrowhead that covers part of that run — and by no more than that.

```
node parser "Parser"
node resolver "Resolver"  right of parser
edge parser -> resolver  "statements"  from: right  to: left
```

Nothing there says how far apart those two nodes are. The default gap is sized for two nodes to breathe rather than to hold a word, so without this the text would be drawn across both of them. Delete the text and the gap closes back to the default. Write `gap: wide` on that placement and nothing further happens, because the minimum you asked for is already the larger of the two — a gap is a minimum, and a text is one more thing bidding into it.

Which gap the text lands in is derived, never stated. Two nodes clear of each other on exactly one axis have exactly one corridor between them, and that is the one that widens. It is judged where the nodes finally sit — after anything centered has been centered and anything overlapping pulled apart — and if widening a gap moves something that was centered on what moved, it is centered again. The same holds between the children of a node, however they are placed. Two sitting corner to corner have no single corridor, because the line runs diagonally through open space, so nothing is widened for them. The room is measured along the run: an edge traveling horizontally needs the text's width, one traveling vertically needs only its depth, so a long text across a vertical gap opens it by a single line and hangs out either side.

An edge with no text asks for nothing, since every gap is wide enough for an arrowhead. An edge carrying a `between` clause asks for nothing here either — its text rides in the channel it named rather than in the gap between its own two ends, and what that does *not* do yet is at the end of the next section but one.

### Which side an edge leaves and arrives on

`from:` and `to:` name a side of the node at each end — `top`, `bottom`, `left` or `right`.

```
edge desktop1.files <-> hub  from: right  to: top
```

That line leaves the right side of `desktop1.files` heading right, and arrives at the top of `hub` heading down. Naming a side is a statement about how the line should leave or arrive, so the edge is drawn as a curve that actually does. An edge naming neither side is a straight line from center to center, unless a box is in the way (see "Going round boxes"). Either end may be named on its own; the unnamed one aims at wherever its partner ended up.

You name a side and never a point on it. Alone on a side, an edge lands at its center. Sharing a side with other edges, the attachments space themselves apart, and which one goes where is derived from where the far ends actually sit — of two edges arriving at one top side, the one coming from further left arrives further left. Move a node and the order follows it. This is the same rule as nodes not overlapping: the tool separates things by default and reads the direction off the solved layout rather than asking you.

The space it leaves is deliberately small, and shrinks further if the side is too short to hold the whole group. On a side short enough, it shrinks to nothing and the attachments coincide. Their texts still come apart, because the lines bow in the middle to make up what the side could not give them, but the arrowheads themselves land on one point and nothing warns you — so a small node with several edges arriving on one side is worth a look.

#### Going round boxes

A line never passes through a box. It takes the shortest way between its ends that goes through none, leaving a named side heading straight out and arriving at one heading straight in, with as few turns as that length allows. When the direct line is clear, that is the line you get. When it is not, the line goes round whatever is in the way. A line you have steered with `between` or `below <node>` finds its way the same way, keeping to what you said as well.

```
node parser "Parser"
node resolver "Resolver"  right of parser
node renderer "Renderer"  right of resolver
edge parser -> renderer  "test edge"  from: left  to: right
```

That line leaves Parser heading left and has to arrive at Renderer from the right, so it must turn back on itself somewhere. The shortest way is out of Parser's left, over the top of the row, and down into Renderer's right. Under the row would be exactly as long, and when two ways round tie, the line goes over the top, or round the right in a column. A node stepped down far enough leaves a gap between the two, and the line turns back through the gap, because that is shorter.

The same rule covers every other case: sides at right angles where one faces away from the other end, two ends naming the same side with one node behind the other, a node back to itself, and a line with no side named that has a box between its ends. Each goes the shortest way round. An end with no side named leaves or arrives by whichever of its box's sides makes the way shortest.

Several lines along the same stretch take a lane each, side by side, instead of drawing on top of one another, nested so that none crosses another where it need not. Where one of them carries its text on that stretch, the others keep clear of the text as well as the line. The text rides on the line's longest straight piece that it does not land on a box from, and never changes which way the line goes.

A curved line and a square one take the same way. The square one turns at corners. The curved one sweeps through them, each sweep as wide as the room around it allows without coming near a box or another line, and a line stepping sideways and carrying on the way it was going is one S. Where the room is tight a sweep comes close to a rounded corner; where there is room it flows. At an arrowhead or any other mark, the line always finishes straight, so the mark points square into the side.

When there is no way at all — the side you named is flush against another box — the file is refused with the reason: `edge a -> b: cannot leave a's right side, b is against it`.

To send a line round the other way, say which side of a node it passes: `below resolver`. See "Passing on one side of a node".

#### Several edges between the same two sides

Edges that run between the *same* pair of sides are a case of their own, because "where the far ends sit" cannot order them: every one of them goes to the same node.

```
edge gateway -> queue  "publishes messages"  from: bottom  to: left
edge queue -> gateway  "receives messages"   from: left    to: bottom
```

Both of those join the bottom of `gateway` to the left of `queue`, so they run in nested lanes. Whichever lane an edge takes on one side, it takes the matching lane on the other — further left along `gateway`'s bottom is further down `queue`'s left — so the lines never cross each other. Any number of edges between one pair of sides nests the same way.

Which edge takes the outer lane is derived where the diagram says anything: two edges pointing opposite ways each keep to one side of their own run, so a reciprocal pair reads as a circulation and re-ordering the two lines changes nothing. Edges pointing the *same* way give the tool nothing to read, and there the order you wrote them in is what decides.

The lanes are as wide as the texts riding in them, so texts come apart with the lines. Note which way that pushes: on a horizontal run the texts stack, a line apart, but on a vertical run they all sit at the same height and have to clear each other sideways, so each lane is a whole text wide.

A side too short to hold the whole group is squeezed, exactly as above — and the room the ends could not give is then made up in the middle, each line bowing across its run by its own share of the shortfall. The captions come apart even where the attachments are packed together. A group that fits its sides is drawn exactly as it was, because the shortfall is nothing.

#### Several edges with no side named at all

Edges between the same two nodes that name no side anywhere have the same problem in a harder form: an unnamed end has no side to be spread along. It aims at the far node's center and attaches wherever that ray crosses the border, so every edge between one pair produces the same point, and three of them come out as one visible line with three texts stacked on it.

```
node a
node b right of a
edge a -> b "first"
edge a -> b "second"
edge a -> b "third"
```

Where an edge would attach is not changed by there being others. What changes is only that they no longer do it in the same place: each takes the line it would have drawn alone and moves it sideways, across its own run, by a lane. The lines are parallel and a lane apart, and where each end lands falls out of that. With the two nodes level, all three attach further up and down the same two sides. With them on a diagonal — where a single line would leave through a corner — the two lines straddle it, and one end lands on each of the two sides meeting there. Neither of those is a case you have to know about; they are the same rule seen from two positions.

Lane order follows the rule above: opposite-pointing edges keep to their own side of the run, same-pointing ones fall back to the order you wrote them in. A lone edge is in no group and is untouched, and naming a side on either end takes an edge out of the group, since it then has a side of its own to be spread along.

Lanes are as wide as the texts riding in them, as with named sides — so two edges between the same two nodes come apart far enough for their captions to clear.

Past a point they cannot: every line still has to attach on the same two sides, and those are only as tall as the nodes. When the group wants more room than the edges can give, the attachments squeeze evenly to fit and each line makes up the shortfall in the middle, bowing across its own run by exactly what its ends could not give it. The texts ride at the midpoints, so they still come apart even though the arrowheads crowd together. The innermost line has no shortfall and stays straight, which is what every group small enough for its nodes looks like.

The bow is the shortfall, not a style — nothing bends until the side is full, and a group that fits is drawn with straight lines exactly as it always was.

### Passing between two things

`between <a> and <b>` says that the line travels down the gap between two named nodes.

```
edge dumps.db1 -> hub  "rclone"  between desktop1 and laptop1  from: right  to: left
```

It says nothing about the rest of the line. The clause binds only the stretch where the line is actually passing that pair — where it enters the span the two of them occupy, it is in the gap between them, and before and after it goes wherever its ends take it. The line takes the shortest way into the gap that goes round every box and keeps its distance from them, runs straight along it, and takes the shortest way out to its far end, as any line does (see "Going round boxes"). Its text rides in the gap.

Which gap is meant is usually derived, not stated. One of the two is above the other, or one is left of the other, and whichever it is says which axis the gap binds — so a channel between something above and something below constrains height, and one between something left and something right constrains width, and in neither case does the file mention an axis at all.

Two nodes sitting diagonally have *two* gaps between them, and there the derivation has nothing to go on. Add `vertically` or `horizontally`:

```
edge c -> d  "threaded"  between a and b vertically
```

`vertically` is the gap you measure with a vertical ruler — under the upper one, over the lower one — so a line running along it travels horizontally. The word describes the gap, not the direction of travel, which is the reading to watch for.

Leave it out on a diagonal pair and the error asks for it, in your own node names. Write it where it was not needed and it is checked rather than quietly dropped, so a pair that is only apart vertically will tell you that `horizontally` is wrong. A pair that touches or overlaps has no gap at all, whatever you write, and naming a pair the edge never actually passes is an error too.

Several edges may share one channel, and they take a lane each, found as every line's lane is (see "Going round boxes"): side by side, arranged so they do not cross where they need not. The lanes are spaced by what is actually running along them: clear of a text where an edge with text runs, an arrow's width apart where none does.

A named channel does not widen. It is measured off the layout you described, so if you name a gap too narrow for the lines you put through it they crowd together rather than pushing the two nodes apart. That is the difference between this and a text making room for itself, above: there, the corridor is the gap between the edge's own two ends, and opening it moves them apart exactly as anything else put between them would. Here the pair is named by an edge merely passing through, and nothing yet lets an edge bid into a gap it is only a visitor in. It is the remaining half and it is not built.

### Passing on one side of a node

`above`, `below`, `left of` and `right of`, written on an edge, say which side of a node the line passes.

```
node parser "Parser"
node resolver "Resolver"  right of parser
node renderer "Renderer"  right of resolver
edge parser -> renderer  "underneath"  from: left  to: right  below resolver
```

They are the placement words, and they mean what `between` means: only where the line passes that node. `below resolver` says the line is below Resolver where it goes by Resolver, not that the whole line is. That edge would go over the top of the row on its own; with the clause it leaves Parser, drops under the row and comes up into Renderer.

Write as many as you need, one for each node you have something to say about. The line meets them in the order they sit along its way, so no clause says an order:

```
node a "A"
node b "B"  below a
edge a -> b  from: top  to: bottom  left of a  right of b
```

That line leaves the top of A, goes round A's left, crosses over in the gap between the two, passes B on the right, and turns up into B's bottom. It finds its way as any line does (see "Going round boxes"): each clause closes off one side of its node — `below resolver` everything above Resolver, within Resolver's width — and the line takes the shortest way that keeps out of those as well as out of every box. Lines told the same things take a lane each rather than one path between them.

One clause may name several nodes, and it is not shorthand for several clauses. `below a and b` is below the box bounding both, so it covers the stretch between them too:

```
node t1 "T1"
node t2 "T2"  right of t1  (gap: wide)
node peak "Peak"  right of t1  left of t2  above t1
edge t1 -> t2  from: bottom  to: bottom  below t1  above peak  below t2
```

Those three clauses let the line rise over Peak in the gap. Write `below t1 and t2  above peak` instead and it is refused, because Peak sits over the stretch `below t1 and t2` covers, and the line cannot be below the one and above the other at the same point.

One edge may pass some nodes above or below and others left or right. Passing above or below is done travelling across the page, and passing left or right travelling up or down it, so the line turns between the two, as few times as it can:

```
node a "A"
node n "N"  below a
node m "M"  below n
node b "B"  right of m  (gap: 80)
edge a -> b  left of n  above m
```

With no clauses that line would run straight from A to B. `left of n` sends it down N's left, and `above m` brings it across between N and M into B, rather than round under M. The clauses read as before: `left of n` binds only where the line is level with N, so the stretch running across below N is not held to it.

A side named at an end says which way the line goes first: `from: right` starts it across, `from: bottom` starts it down. With no side named, the line takes whichever way keeps the clauses with the fewest turns, and a straight line that already keeps them stays straight.

Clauses of one kind may sit on different legs. Here the line goes over P on the way out, down past N, and under M on the way in, turning twice:

```
node a "A"
node p "P"  right of a
node n "N"  below p  right of p
node m "M"  below n  right of n
node b "B"  right of m
edge a -> b  from: right  to: bottom  above p  right of n  below m
```

Each clause binds whichever legs pass its node, so a node wide enough to sit under two legs holds both of them to its side.

Refused, each by name:

- **Clauses that cannot all hold** at one point, as above.
- **A crossing with no room.** Two clauses on opposite sides need a gap between their nodes to cross over in. Placed flush — `gap: 0` — there is none, and the error says to give the placement a gap or drop a clause. The gap is never opened for the line: you wrote how far apart those two are.
- **A node the line never passes.** `below z` on a line that never goes by Z says nothing.
- **No way keeps them all.** Where the clauses and the boxes between them leave no way through, the error names every clause.
- **`between` with a side.** An edge passing between two things already has a side of each.
- **A part of a node, or a gap.** A line passes a whole box, and passes it as close as reads clearly.

An end with no side named leaves by whichever side makes the way shortest.

### How the line is drawn

Everything about the line itself goes in its bracket:

```
edge api -> db  line: (path: square, corners: rounded)
edge api -> cache  line: (pattern: dashed, thickness: thin)
edge web -> api  line: (color: #d2904e, thickness: thick, crossing: arc)
```

`line: red` is short for `line: (color: red)`, and is still the way to write a color alone. Every other property needs the bracket, and `line: square` is refused with the bracket it meant. Like any attribute, the bracket may go on an edge, in a style, or on `default edge` — `default edge  line: (path: square, corners: rounded)` draws a whole diagram with right angles.

| property | takes | says |
|---|---|---|
| `color` | a color | as `line:` alone |
| `path` | `curved` (the default), `square`, `straight` | how the line joins the points it has to meet |
| `corners` | `sharp` (the default), `rounded` | how a square or straight line turns |
| `crossing` | `gap` (the default), `none`, `arc`, `square` | how the line is drawn where it crosses an earlier one |
| `pattern` | `solid` (the default), `dashed`, `dotted`, `dash-dot` | |
| `thickness` | `thin`, `normal` (the default), `thick`, or a number of pixels | |

**A path is the rule for joining what the file fixed**: where the line leaves and which way it heads, where it arrives and from which direction, and any sides it passes. Out of A's top and into B's left, with B up and to the right:

- `curved` bends round from heading up to heading right. It is how every line was drawn before there was a choice, including the straight line an edge naming no sides has always been.
- `square` goes up, then across into B — one right angle, because leaving upward and arriving from the left fixes which way it turns. A square line naming no sides picks them: boxes sharing a column join top to bottom, boxes sharing a row side to side, and otherwise the line goes across first, then down. An end naming no side, beside one that does, takes whichever side needs the fewest turns.
- `straight` is one straight piece from A's top to B's left, ignoring which way each faces. Given `below c` or `between a and b`, it bends where that clause puts a point it has to pass, and nowhere else.

**Corners** apply wherever a line has them: every bend in a square line, and the bends a clause puts in a straight one. A curved line has none, so `corners: rounded` written on a curved edge is refused. From a style or a default it rounds the edges that have corners and leaves curved ones alone, as a style's `fill:` lands only on the things that have an inside.

**A crossing is drawn on the later line**: the edge written further down the file jumps the one written above it. `gap`, the default, is a short break in the later line, as though it passed underneath; `arc` is a small half-circle hop, `square` a three-sided jump, and `none` draws the two lines straight across each other. A line never jumps within reach of its own ends, where two lines meeting at a box are not passing each other.

**A pattern is measured in thicknesses**, so dashes keep their proportions on a thick line.

**A thick line takes room.** Its arrowhead grows with it, and the room an edge's text makes for itself counts the arrowhead it will actually have, so thickening a line with text between two close nodes can push them apart — the same way a larger text grows its node. Color, path, corners, crossings and pattern move nothing.

## Against a part of a node

```
<direction> of <node> <part>
inside <node> <part>
outside <node> <part>
on <node> <part>
```

A placement's target may be a node, as everywhere else, or **a part of a node** — written as the node's name and the part as a separate word. The parts are a node's `text`, its four sides `top`, `bottom`, `left` and `right`, and its nine points:

```
top-left      top-center      top-right
left-center   center          right-center
bottom-left   bottom-center   bottom-right
```

Those nine are the whole set, and every part of the language that has a position accepts all of them. They are words anybody can point at without measuring, which is what makes them allowed where `x: 140` is not — and a diagram written in them still moves correctly when a box moves, which is the property that refusal exists to protect.

**A side is a segment and a point is a point,** and the spelling is what says which. Bare `top`, `bottom`, `left` and `right` name a side, which is why every midpoint carries `-center`: `right` is the whole right edge, `right-center` is the one point halfway down it. Naming a side leaves the other axis free, so `inside plate right` sits against that edge and centers down it; `inside plate right-center` pins it to the midpoint.

Three direction words go with a part target:

| | |
|---|---|
| `inside` | wholly within, against that part |
| `outside` | wholly beyond it |
| `on` | centered on it, so a node on a corner straddles it |

```
node bob "Bob the builder"
node bob_link "bob.example.com"  inside bob bottom-center
```

**`inside` and `outside` are shorthands, and their long form is derived rather than listed.** *Inside* is the direction from the named part toward the box's center and *outside* is away from it, so `inside right` is `left of`, `inside top-right` is `below-left of`, and one rule covers every part. `inside <node> center` and `inside <node> text` are errors: neither part is on the boundary, so there is no direction toward the interior from them.

**`on` is the one that is not a shorthand.** It is a center alignment on both axes at once, which the language did not otherwise have — `level with` gives the vertical and the edge alignments give whichever axis their edge belongs to, and there is no horizontal center alignment at all. It takes no gap: a center sits on a point rather than a distance from it.

The inset for `inside` is a gap on the placement. If nothing says, it is `tight` against another node's box and the box's own padding against the node's own parent — see [Against its own parent](#against-its-own-parent). `(gap: none)` puts the node hard against the edge. It is deliberately *not* the node's own `gap:`, which says how the node stands off its neighbours — a node marked `gap: wide` so its siblings keep clear should not thereby wear its mark 110 pixels in from the corner.

**Saying `inside` or `on` is saying the overlap,** so there is nothing for the overlap error to report about that pair. Everything else in the drawing still keeps clear in the ordinary way.

`inside`, `outside` and `on` take one target. A direction may name several — `right of a and b` means "clear of the box bounding both", which is a floor and decomposes into one demand per target — but these three read a direction off one part of one box.

### Against its own parent

A child may name a part of the node it is inside. **The dotted name is what decides what happens:** a child grows its parent to hold it, and a stranger does not.

```
node server "Server"
node server.web "web"
node server.db "database"
node server.mark "!"  inside server right level with server.db
node stamp "!"  on server top-right
```

`server` widens so `server.mark` sits against its right edge, held in by the padding, on the database's row. A side word straight after `inside`, `outside` or `on <node>` is always the part, so `right level with` here is not read as the right-edge alignment. `stamp` is not part of `server`, so nothing moves for it: it lies over the corner, half in and half out.

The title band is not something a node has; it is what happens when things stack below the text. Children that say nothing about where they go stack below the text in written order, as they always have, and that is what makes the band. A node whose children all sit beside its text or against its frame has nothing below its text, so it has no band and draws as a leaf — its text centered, and whatever is placed against the text centered with it as one group:

```
node hub "Cloud sync"
node hub.star "★"  right of hub text
```

**A child against its own parent is spaced as that parent spaces what it holds.** `inside` insets it by the padding, a placement against the parent's text stands off by the step the contents are stacked by, and the parent's own `gap:` — which says how the parent stands off its neighbours — does not reach it. A gap written on the placement still wins.

To give a node a band on purpose, place things below its text. The band is the same one the contents would have made — title at the top, what was placed beneath it one step below:

```
node q "Deployment"
node q.a "north-west"  below q text  inside q left
node q.b "north-east"  below q text  inside q right
node q.c "south-west"  inside q bottom-left
node q.d "south-east"  inside q bottom-right
```

A text given an `at:` in a node with no band ranges in the room its own row and column leave it — between whatever sits beside, above or below it — not across the whole box, so a `top-right` title stops short of a child in the top-right corner rather than pushing it out.

A child placed against one of its parent's sides stands beside the rest of the box, not above or below it: if it would cover the title or the contents, the box grows across for a left or right side and down for a top or bottom one. `overlap: allow` on the child is the other answer — "I am inside my parent, do not grow for me" — and it lies over whatever is there.

**A child placed `outside` its parent is still part of it.** The parent does not grow for it, but everything that keeps clear of the parent keeps clear of the child too: `right of router` lands beyond the note hanging off Router's right side, not on top of it, and a container holding Router widens to hold the note. An alignment still reads the parent's own box, so `below router` centers under Router and not under Router and its note together.

### Several nodes saying the same thing

```
node hub "hub"
node a "one"    right of hub
node b "two"    right of hub
node c "three"  right of hub
```

Three nodes that say the identical thing are one list, not three boxes on one spot. It runs down the page in the order they were written, and is centered on `hub` as a whole — the balanced picture that "hub points at three things" means, which no chain of placements can draw. The same goes for a part: three children `inside p right` are a column against that edge, and three at `inside p top-right` stack into the corner and grow down. The list runs down the page whatever the direction, so three nodes `below hub` are a column under it.

Only the identical placement makes a list; add `level with x` to one of them and it places itself. `overlap: allow` asks for the literal pile instead.

**A direction and a position are two vocabularies and stay two.** A *direction* is a relation between two nodes and puts this one outside the other, clear of it by a gap: `above-left of hub`. A *position* is a point of one box: `inside hub top-left`. They reach the same corner with different words on purpose, because `above hub` could never become `top of hub` — "the top of the hub" is unambiguously its edge.

## Notes and other bare text

There is no `note` statement. A note is a node with no body:

```
node aside "Written by a nightly cron job." (wrap: 30)  shape: none  below dumps  gap: tight
```

A keyword names a picture, and "note" names a use. The picture is *text with no box*, and that serves plenty of uses which are not asides — a caption on a brace, a title over a diagram. So the keyword went and the picture stayed. An older file writing `note` gets an error quoting the replacement.

Nothing bounds bare text the way a border bounds a node, so a sentence-length one without a `wrap` is drawn as one very long line and will cross whatever is beside it. Give every one a wrap.

`shape: none` starts one step smaller than a node's text, because an aside at the same size reads as a statement. That is a default, not a ceiling: say `(size: …)` and it does what you said.

## Decks

```
node drive "Drive 1"  deck: "Drive 2" "Drive 3"
```

`deck:` draws offset copies behind a box, one per text, back to front, to say "there are several of these and they are the same." Only the front copy shows its contents. It goes on a box only; a picture or a `shape: none` node has no outline to repeat, and refuses it. A style may carry it.

**Changed after 0.3.0.** This was a statement of its own, `deck drive "Drive 2" "Drive 3"`, which created nothing and only said more about a node declared elsewhere. The statement is now an error that quotes the attribute to write instead.

## Attributes

Every attribute, and what takes one. The kinds here are what a node's **body** is rather than which keyword declared it — every one of the three is written `node`, and each takes a different set.

| attribute | `shape:` | `icon:` | `shape: none` | edge | says |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `style` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | the named bundles to take appearance from, one or a list |
| `gap` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | | the default distance to whatever it is placed against |
| `overlap` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | | `allow`, to opt out of non-overlap |
| `contents` | ✓ | | | | how the children are sized and where the block of them sits, in brackets |
| `badge` | ✓ | | | | the picture beside the text |
| `deck` | ✓ | | | | offset copies behind the box, one quoted text each |
| `shape` | ✓ | | ✓ | | the outline the node is drawn with, `none` included |
| `icon` | | ✓ | | | the picture the node is drawn as |
| `from` `to` | | | | ✓ | which side the line leaves and arrives on |
| `from-mark` `to-mark` | | | | ✓ | what is drawn at each end — see "What is drawn at each end" |
| `fill` | ✓ | | | | color — see "A color names the part it colors" |
| `border` | ✓ | | | | color |
| `text` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | the text's properties, in brackets — a style's form of what a node or an edge writes after its own words |
| `line` | | | | ✓ | color, or everything about the line in brackets — see "How the line is drawn" |
| `url` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | a destination to open when the thing is clicked |

The `diagram` statement has a vocabulary of its own — `theme`, `background` and `text` — which is checked the same way. Writing `background:` on a node is an error that points at `fill:`, and `theme:` on one points at `diagram theme:`. A `default` takes a narrower list for each kind; see "Defaults".

**A word this table does not give the kind is an error.** The two ways of being wrong get different answers, because they have different remedies. A word that is an attribute nowhere is a misspelling, and the error lists what the kind does take. A word that is an attribute *somewhere else* is usually a real statement written on the wrong half of the diagram, so the error says where it belongs:

```
"one" is a node and has from: left. `from:` belongs to an edge — a node takes style, gap, ...
```

Some of the gaps in the table are worth saying out loud, because none of them looks like a mistake while you are writing it. A picture and a bodiless node take no `fill:` or `border:` — there is no outline for either to reach. Neither takes `contents:` either, which says how a node's children sit, and neither may have any. `shape:` and `icon:` each appear only on the kind they make, and writing both is an error naming both. An edge takes no `gap:` or `overlap:` — those say where a node sits, and an edge is not placed, it joins two things that are.

**A key is written once per statement.** `fill: red  fill: blue` is an error that quotes both values and asks you to keep one: two words on one line are equally explicit, so nothing says which was meant, and keeping either would drop the other in silence. It is almost always an edit that forgot to delete the old value. The same holds inside brackets — `(size: small, size: large)`, a placement's `(gap: wide, gap: tight)` — for `style:` written twice, and for a `style` statement that repeats one of its own keys. Two `text: (…)` brackets in one style are fine as long as they say different things. A node overriding its style is not a repeat; see "Styles".

**Changed 2026-09-09.** Until then a node or edge attribute the tool did not recognize was parsed, stored and never read: `wibble: red` on a node drew nothing and said nothing. This was the last place in the language where a key could silently do nothing, and the rule everywhere else — an unknown `diagram` key, an unknown placement modifier, a color naming a part the kind has not got — has always been that a key which silently does nothing looks like the tool being broken rather than like a typo. A file that rendered with a stray word in it will now stop with an error naming it.

## Destinations

```
node docs "Documentation"  url: "https://example.com/docs"
edge docs -> store "read first"  url: "https://example.com/order"
```

`url:` makes the thing clickable in a viewer that follows links — a browser showing the SVG, or a page it is embedded in. The whole thing is the target: a node's box and everything drawn in it, an edge's text. A rasteriser ignores it, so a PNG is unaffected.

**The value is quoted.** Without the quotes everything from the `//` onwards is a comment, so `url: https://example.com` would set the destination to `https:`. The error for the unquoted form says so rather than reporting a missing value.

**Nothing about a destination is visible.** A clickable node looks like any other. Color was considered and dropped: an edge with no text and a node that is nothing but a picture have nothing to color, so it would be a decoration that sometimes applies — and a destination is *content*, while color is appearance, and nothing else in the language lets one reach the other. An author who wants a destination to look like one writes the color themselves.

**A style may not carry one**, for the same reason: a style is a bundle worn by many things, and one `url:` in it would point every one of them at the same place.

**A container's destination reaches its children.** A child that names none of its own is clickable with its container's, and one that names its own overrules it inside its own box — so a container catches every click its children do not.

**An edge with no text is refused one.** The line is a pixel and a half wide, which is a target nobody can hit; a destination that technically works and practically does not is the silent defect this language refuses everywhere else.

## Styles

```
style <name> <attributes>
```

A named bundle of appearance, applied with `style: <name>` on a node or edge. Color carries meaning through the style name rather than being written per node.

```
style backup  border: #d2904e
node server.mirror "shared folder / mirror"  style: backup
```

The appearance attributes are `fill`, `border`, `line`, `text`, `badge`, `icon` and `shape`. The first three each take a color written as the viewer will receive it — `#142814`, or any CSS color, or `none`; `text` takes the bracket described under "The text and its brackets".

**What a statement says itself beats what its style says**, wherever `style:` sits on the line. Here the server's border is red, not orange:

```
style backup  border: #d2904e
node server "Server"  border: red  style: backup
```

Whoever wrote `border: red` on the node meant it for that node, so it is an override rather than a contradiction, and nothing is refused. The rest of the style still applies.

**A thing may take several styles**, listed the way a placement lists its targets — commas and `and` both separate:

```
node pump "Pump 3"  style: equipment, critical and alarm
```

They apply in the order written, and a later style wins where two set the same key; the statement's own words still win over all of them. Each style in the list is checked on its own, so one that gives the thing nothing is refused even when its neighbors do not. A style named twice in one list is refused, and so is `style:` written twice on one statement — the list is the way to say several.

### A color names the part it colors

A color attribute says which part of a thing it colors, and a part exists only on the kinds that have one:

| attribute | colors | on |
|---|---|---|
| `fill` | the area inside the outline | a node |
| `border` | the outline | a node |
| `text: (color: …)` | the text | every node, and an edge |
| `line` | the drawn line and the marks at its ends | an edge |

A word written on a kind that has no such part is refused by name, and the error lists the parts that kind does have — `border:` on a node with no body is a mistake, not something to ignore, for the same reason an unknown `diagram` key is.

An edge's text takes the line's color unless its own brackets say otherwise, so an edge that means something by being orange means it in its words too, and there is still a way to say the words are not orange.

A style contributes a part only to the kinds that have it, so a style shared between nodes and edges writes one key for each:

```
style backup  border: #d2904e  line: #d2904e
```

The nodes take the border, the edges take the line, and neither sees the other's word. Writing only `border` there would color the nodes and leave the edges plain.

### A style may carry what a thing cannot use

The table under "Attributes" is checked against what you wrote *on the statement*, never against what a style handed it. That is what makes a bundle spanning kinds possible at all: the benchmark's `style synced` carries a fill and a border for five nodes and a `line` for the four edges joining them, and every use of it leaves some of its keys unused. That is the style doing its job, not a mistake, so nothing is said about it.

What is refused is a style that gives a thing **nothing at all**:

```
style boxy  fill: #142814  badge: disk
node n "An aside"  shape: none  style: boxy
```

A node with no body is bare text, with neither a fill nor a badge, so `boxy` dresses it in nothing whatever and the name is on the wrong sort of thing. Partial overlap is the normal case; zero overlap is never anything else. A style that named every attribute in the language would slip through this, since it contributes to everything by construction — nobody writes one by accident, and the hole is left open rather than closed with a rule that would fire on `synced`.

A style's own keys are checked against the whole vocabulary, since a word that is an attribute of nothing is a misspelling wherever it sits. `style s  wibble: red` is an error; a style was the last place one could hide.

**Removed: `stroke`.** It named no part — it meant the border of a node, the *text* of one drawn as a picture or with no body at all, and the line of an edge, whichever the thing happened to have. That is coherent one kind at a time and ambiguous read across them; it meant no ink attribute could ever be *wrong*; and it left one thing with no way to be said at all, the color of the text on an ordinary node. An older file carrying it gets an error naming the word to use instead.

A color is never written in quotes, and a quoted one is refused. There is nothing to check a color *against* — the tool keeps no list of color words, as below — so this is the one thing that can be checked, and it is the mistake that actually gets made: every attribute that takes a color would otherwise accept a quoted string, find it is not a color, and draw nothing without saying so.

There is no list of color words the tool knows. An earlier version had one, and it was wrong in the way such lists always are: `dark-green` existed only because somebody added it to a map in the renderer, and the next color a diagram wanted would have needed a code change to say. Writing the color directly removes both the list and the reason to grow it. `green` still works, because it is a CSS color, not because this tool has heard of it.

A style carrying `text: (color: theme-muted)` is what a marked-up word borrows from, which is how a node carries a name with a quieter qualifier under it:

```
style synced  fill: #142814  border: #486544
style dim     text: (color: theme-muted)
node pc.files "shared folder / [dim]synced[/dim]"  style: synced
```

**Removed: `subtext`.** It colored every text line after the first, which is a positional slice: the rule lived in a style elsewhere in the file and was applied by counting, so a reader of `"shared folder / synced"` could not see that the second line was quiet. The mark says what is quiet where it is quiet, and reaches a word in the middle of a line, which the slice never could. An older file carrying it gets an error naming the mark to write instead.

`badge`, `icon` and `shape` belong in a style for the same reason a color does: they say what kind of thing this is, and a kind wants to look alike everywhere it appears. `style artifact  fill: theme-secondary-subtle  shape: document` puts the folded corner on every dump in the diagram, and the use site stays one word.

`theme-muted` means the theme's secondary text color rather than a fixed one, so a quiet line stays readable when the theme changes. Writing `#8b8b8b` instead would pin it to one theme. Say nothing and every line of a text reads alike, which is what most texts want — `Computer 1 / Ubuntu` is two lines of one name, not a name and a qualifier, and the distinction is the author's to make rather than the renderer's to guess.

## The diagram itself

```
diagram <attributes>
```

Settings that belong to the drawing as a whole rather than to anything in it. There is no name, because a file holds one diagram, and a second `diagram` statement is an error rather than a second opinion.

```
diagram  theme: nord  background: #1e2229  text: (color: #e0e0e0)
```

Three attributes:

- `theme` names the theme that supplies every color the file does not state. See "Themes" below.
- `background` takes a color the same way `fill` does, and it colors the page behind everything, including the strip an edge text knocks out of whatever it crosses. Say nothing and the theme's own background stands.
- `text: (color: …)` sets the color of every text, on nodes and edges alike. It takes a color and nothing else; a text size is about one kind of text and belongs on a `default`.

An unknown key is refused by name — `diagram has no "backround" — it takes theme, background, text` — rather than quietly ignored, the same as every other attribute. See "Attributes".

### Themes

```
diagram  theme: solarized-dark
```

| theme | |
|---|---|
| `dark` | the default: the palette of the benchmark drawing |
| `light` | the same roles on a white page |
| `solarized-dark`, `solarized-light` | [Solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) |
| `gruvbox-dark`, `gruvbox-light` | [Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) |
| `catppuccin-mocha`, `catppuccin-latte` | [Catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com) |
| `nord` | [Nord](https://www.nordtheme.com) |
| `dracula` | [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com) |
| `vesper` | [Vesper](https://github.com/raunofreiberg/vesper) |
| `high-contrast-dark`, `high-contrast-light` | no fills to lean on, every line at full strength |
| `print` | a white page, black lines and no fills, for paper |

The borrowed palettes were made for code, where a color marks a keyword or a string. A diagram needs a page, a box, a border, text and a line, so each theme is its scheme read as a diagram rather than a copy of it. Their licenses are in `NOTICE`.

A theme only ever supplies a color, so changing it never moves anything. A color you write yourself — `fill: #14532d`, or a style's — stays that color under every theme, which means a hand-picked color can clash with a theme it was not chosen against. To color something and have it follow the theme, name a theme color instead.

An unknown name is an error that lists the themes.

### Theme colors

Every theme defines the same set of colors, and any attribute that takes a color takes their names. All of them begin `theme-`, so a color that follows the theme says so, and no CSS color name is taken: `red` is still CSS red.

The theme's own color for each part — what a box or a line gets when the file says nothing:

| color | is |
|---|---|
| `theme-page` | the page |
| `theme-text` | text |
| `theme-muted` | quieter, secondary text |
| `theme-fill` | a box's fill |
| `theme-border` | a box's outline |
| `theme-line` | a line |

And its two accents, each at two strengths, with the text that reads on it:

| color | is |
|---|---|
| `theme-primary` | the theme's signature color — Dracula's purple, Solarized's blue |
| `theme-primary-subtle` | the same mixed toward the page: dark on a dark theme, pale on a light one |
| `theme-on-primary` | text that reads on a solid `theme-primary` |
| `theme-secondary`, `theme-secondary-subtle`, `theme-on-secondary` | the same for its second color |

```
style synced  fill: theme-primary-subtle  border: theme-primary
style live    fill: theme-primary
style dim     text: (color: theme-muted)
```

A subtle fill is how a box is set apart: its text is the theme's ordinary text, and it reads in every theme. A solid fill is a badge. A box with a theme fill and no text color of its own gets text that reads on that fill, so `style live` above needs no `text:` — its text is `theme-on-primary`. A hand-picked fill gets no such help; its text is the theme's, as before.

A `theme-` name the theme does not define is refused with the list above.

The command line can render a file in another theme without editing it — `reladraw arch.reladraw --theme light` — and the flag wins over the file's `theme:`. That is how one source becomes a light and a dark image for a README that shows whichever matches the reader's settings. The file's own `background:` and `text:` still win over the flag's theme, as a hand-written color wins over any theme.

### Defaults

```
default node       border: #4a8a5c
default leaf       fill: #2e5d3a
default container  fill: #1a2620  border: #2a3a30
default edge       line: #7a8a99  text: (color: #9aa5b1, size: small)
```

A default is a style that every thing of one kind wears without naming it. `node` covers every node; `leaf` a node with no children, and `container` a node with some — the same "has children" the theme's quieter backdrop colors follow, so setting a leaf's fill leaves containers looking like containers. `edge` covers every edge.

The more specific word wins, all the way down:

1. the theme
2. `diagram`
3. `default node`
4. `default leaf` or `default container`, or `default edge`
5. the thing's styles, a later one winning where two set the same key
6. what the thing's own line says

A default takes the words a style does, and may name a style of its own with `style:`, which it lays beneath its own words. Unlike a style, it is strict about kind: it names the kind it is for, so a word that kind has no use for can only be a mistake. `default edge  fill: red` is refused and points at `line:`. `badge:` is refused on `default leaf` and `default node`, since a badge is a child and would make every leaf a container, and `icon:` is a leaf's alone, since a picture cannot hold children. A `url:` belongs to one thing, never to a kind.

Each kind is written at most once. `default leaf` twice is an error naming both lines, and `default leaf node` is refused with `default leaf` — a leaf is already a node.

## What the language refuses

Deliberate omissions. What they protect is that the renderer never *chooses* an arrangement — it computes the one you described. Working out coordinates from a stated arrangement is arithmetic and is not what is being refused here; picking between arrangements that all satisfy what you wrote is. There is exactly one narrow exception, and it is named as such under "Nodes do not overlap".

- **Coordinates**, in any form, including as an escape hatch.
- **Guessing an axis nobody constrained.** When two placements bind one axis and nothing binds the other, the tool refuses rather than picking a target to center on. Choosing there would decide which row a node shares, not how far it sits from something.
- **Placements that run in a circle.** A loop where each placement demands more room than the last cannot be satisfied and is an error naming the placements involved. A target does *not* have to be positioned before the node naming it — the whole system is solved at once — so ordinary mutual references are fine.
- **Edge waypoints.** A point a line must pass through is a coordinate wearing a hat. Saying a line goes between two named things is not one — it names things the diagram already contains, and it survives those things moving.
- **Choosing where a line goes when you said.** The tool finds its own way round a box in a line's way, but only as the shortest way through the open space, so where a line goes follows from where the boxes are. When you want a particular way instead, `between` and `below <node>` say it, and the tool keeps to what they say.
- **Set-level placement.** Four siblings around a hub are four statements today. Whether a durable group that reflows when a member is added is worth the same-axis conflict it introduces is undecided.

Note what is *not* on this list: saying more about where something goes. A statement that lets you be more precise is not a step toward auto-layout, and the first version was short enough of them to render the benchmark wrong.

## Not built yet

Designed, decided, and absent from the code. Written down so the next version has somewhere to start.

**Nothing keeps an edge clear of a node on its own.** Non-overlap applies to nodes only. A line may still cut across a node it has nothing to do with, and an edge text may still land on top of one. `between` and `below <node>` are how you say where a line goes when that matters, and nothing checks the ones where you have not said. A check belongs on the diagnostics list, but finding a route by itself does not — see "What the language refuses".

**A named channel cannot make room for itself.** Lines through a `between` gap too narrow for them crowd together silently, in exactly the way attachments on a too-short side do. An edge with text *does* now open the gap between its own two ends — see "A text makes room for itself" — and it does so by the measure-then-constrain route that region alignments already use, which is the route this wants too. What is missing is the harder case: several edges sharing a channel between two nodes neither of them is an end of, where the room needed is the whole stack of lanes rather than one text.

## Known to be wrong

Not omissions — defects, left here so nobody rediscovers them. Most were found by rendering the benchmark diagram; the last was not, and that is the interesting one, because the benchmark could never have caught it.

~~A placement written after an attribute was an error.~~ Gone entirely in 0.3.0, along with the papercut about how it was reported. `node q "Q"  gap: wide  level with p` is now an ordinary statement. The rule existed only because a bare `gap:` written between two placements could not be told from the node-wide default; [bracketing a gap onto its placement](#a-gap-belongs-to-the-placement) removed that ambiguity and left the ordering rule with nothing to protect.

**A bracketed node sits against one side of any slack.** When two opposing placements leave more room than the node needs — because something else forced the two targets further apart — the node sits against the side it was pushed from rather than centered between them. In practice the tightest arrangement usually leaves no slack, so this rarely shows. Whether it should center instead is not decided.

~~A node placed only with `left of` or `above` drifted to the canvas edge.~~ Fixed. Every constraint reads "this one is at least so far right of that one", so the solve puts each node at the smallest position its constraints allow — right for anything with something behind it, but `left of X` bounds *X* rather than the node that wrote it, leaving such a node nothing to be pushed by. It settled at the edge of the drawing while its target was carried off by the rest of the diagram. A node with nothing behind it now travels until the first of its own placements binds, which is what "as close together as your placements allow" always said.

~~An annotation could not be put beside the rows it was about.~~ Fixed by letting a placement name several targets, which places the node against the region bounding them. The workaround before it was to wrap the targets in an invisible container so there was a single thing to name, which made the author declare a node to stand in for an idea the language could have expressed directly — and cost the container's padding on top.

~~One relation cannot say what a real arrangement needs.~~ Fixed by letting a node carry several placements: it takes its horizontal position from one target and its vertical from another, and two opposing placements put it between two more.

~~The unwritten axis is a silent guess.~~ Fixed. A lone placement's centering is now the documented meaning of the direction rather than a fallback, and the case where it would have to choose between two targets is an error.

~~Two nodes can land on the same pixels in silence.~~ Fixed. Every pair of nodes must now clear the other, and where the file does not order them the tool says so instead of drawing one over the other. Edges are still unchecked.

~~Gaps get used as a fixing hack.~~ Fixed by making every gap a minimum. Room for something is made by saying that something goes there, not by widening a number on an unrelated line.

~~A text cannot contain a slash.~~ Fixed in two parts: the line-break marker now needs whitespace on both sides, so `TCP/IP`, `16/9`, `I/O` and every path and URL survive untouched, and `\/` escapes the marker for a text that wants a spaced slash and no break, such as `Before \/ After`.

That one was found by testing the lexer, not by rendering — and it could not have been found by rendering, because every text in the benchmark happens to use spaces around its separator. Worth knowing that the repository's own second test target is an OSI and **TCP/IP** diagram, so a picture the language was meant to be tested against could not have been written in it. A benchmark only exercises the cases it happens to contain.

~~An edge with text between two nodes at the default gap drew its text across both of them.~~ Fixed. The default gap is sized for nodes to breathe and a text is wider than that, so `edge a -> b "statements"` on two adjacent nodes came out unreadable and nothing said so; the authoring workaround was to name a wider gap on a placement that had no reason to be wider. An edge with text now widens the corridor it crosses by what the text needs. Note what this is *not*: no coordinate, no repair of a solved layout, and nothing that finds a route — the corridor is derived from where the nodes landed and then becomes an ordinary minimum distance like any other.

~~Two edges between the same pair of sides were drawn on top of each other.~~ Fixed. Each side was ordered on its own, by where the far ends sat, and for edges that share both ends that signal says nothing — so the two edges were ordered without reference to each other and the lines converged in the middle instead of nesting. The visible damage was to the texts: both landed at the same point and the second knocked a hole through the first, leaving one word of it. A group like this now takes one lane order used at both ends. See "Several edges between the same two sides".

~~Several edges between the same two nodes with no side named were drawn on top of each other.~~ Fixed. This is the same defect as the one above, one step out: a bundle is a statement about two named sides, and an end with no side named has not made one, so nothing saw the group. `edge a -> b` three times drew one visible line carrying one text. Each such edge now takes its own line, parallel to the one it would have drawn alone and a lane away from it. Note what did *not* change: an unnamed end still attaches where the center-to-center ray crosses the border, so no single edge anywhere moved. See "Several edges with no side named at all".

~~A text's properties sat among the node's.~~ Gone in 0.3.0. `size:`, `wrap:` and the text color `text:` were top-level attributes, sitting beside `fill:` and `shape:` as though how big a text is set were a fact about the node. They are in the brackets after the text now, where the reader can see what they modify, and an older file writing one at the top level gets an error naming the bracket. `at:` came with them and grew from `top | bottom` to the nine named positions, which is the same repair one level down: two of the nine had been handed out because those were the two somebody needed.

~~An unknown attribute was ignored in silence.~~ Fixed. `wibble: red` on a node parsed, was stored, and was never read again — nothing drew and nothing was said. So did every real attribute written on a kind with no use for it: `align:` on a node that may have no children, `gap:` on an edge. This was the same defect the color parts had closed one level down a version earlier, and it is how that migration produced false results from the repository's own regression check, since the older build simply dropped every `border:` it had not heard of. See "Attributes".

~~An edge text ignored the line break.~~ Fixed. ` / ` split a node's text and was never applied to an edge's, so the marker came out as a literal slash on an arrow and the benchmark's two-line captions had to be flattened to one. The measurer had always returned the split lines; the renderer was handing it the raw string and drawing that instead. The block now centers on the point the text already occupied, so a one-line text sits exactly where it did.

~~An edge whose ends faced away from each other was drawn through its own nodes.~~ Fixed. `from: left  to: right` with the far node further right was one curve bending out at both ends, and with the two nodes in a row it flattened into a straight line through both of them and anything between, its text landing on whatever was in the middle. It was not a matter of exact alignment: a node stepped down a little drew a tilted version of the same line. Such an edge now turns back in the gap between its nodes if there is room, and goes over the top of the row if not. See "Going round boxes".

## Changelog

Pre-1.0, so the minor number is where a breaking change goes. Every removal below is refused by name with the replacement quoted, rather than dropped in silence — an older file stops with an error saying what to write instead.

**0.16.0**

A name containing `:` or `;` is now refused; nothing else that worked is. No example diagram draws differently.

- A key may be written against its value: `gap:tight` is `gap: tight`, and `(gap:wide)` and `line:(color:red)` work too. The amount of whitespace never mattered, and now none counts as an amount.
- Breaking: a name may no longer contain `:` or `;`. A colon now makes the word before it a key, and a semicolon is reserved. `node a:b` used to declare a node called `a:b`, and is now refused with an error saying why.
- `right of a, gap: tight` names the comma as the mistake. A comma after a target promises another, and the error used to blame `tight`, two words further on.

**0.15.1**

No syntax changes, and no file that worked is refused. No example diagram draws differently.

- A fix: many copies of one line slowed down sharply past fifty-five. With fifty-six or more copies of `edge a -> b  from: left  to: right`, the ends on each side sat under half a pixel apart, and every copy was then routed on its own instead of being drawn as a copy, so sixty took five and a half seconds. They now draw as copies however close their ends sit, and sixty take under a second.

**0.15.0**

No file that worked is refused. No example diagram draws differently.

- Icons of your own. `icon crate """<svg …>…</svg>"""` declares one from pasted SVG, or `icon crate "./crate.svg"` from a file, and `icon: crate` and `badge: crate` then use it like a built-in. One with a built-in's name replaces it. See [Your own icons](#your-own-icons).

**0.14.4**

No syntax changes, and no file that worked is refused. No example diagram draws differently.

- Faster: lines steered with `between` in a busy diagram. When looking for its way, such a line didn't account for the gap it still had to pass through, so it searched much of the diagram before finding it. A test diagram with four of them among forty-four other lines drew in 6.8 seconds, and now draws in about 5.5.

**0.14.3**

No syntax changes, and no file that worked is refused. No example diagram draws differently.

- A fix: many curved lines into one side could hang the page. With twenty-two copies of `edge a -> b  from: right  to: left`, some lines had no room left to curve before the arrowhead, and the tool kept trying ever smaller curves thousands of times. It now stops at the smallest, and the same file draws in a tenth of a second.

**0.14.2**

No syntax changes, and no file that worked is refused.

- Many copies of one line draw far faster. Lines with the same two ends, the same sides, the same clauses and no text are now drawn as one line and its copies, each a lane further out, instead of each finding its own way round the copies before it. Fifteen copies of `edge a -> b  from: left  to: right` took about a third of a second and forty took two and a half; forty now take half a second. Where such copies used to split, some going over the top and some underneath, they now stay together. A copy that would run into a box or cross a line the first one does not is still found as before.
- Curved lines in busy diagrams draw faster. No picture changes.

**0.14.1**

No syntax changes, and no file that worked is refused.

- Diagrams with many lines draw far faster. Since 0.13.0, the time to find the lines' ways grew much faster than the number of lines: a tangled diagram of 45 boxes and 48 lines took over half an hour. It now takes a few seconds, and ten lines take under one. No example diagram draws differently.
- After every line is placed, lines that cross are placed again in the other order, to cross fewer. That now stops after as many attempts as there are lines. In a very tangled diagram a line may cross another where 0.13.0 and 0.14.0 found a way round; `from:`/`to:`, `below` and `between` say where a line should go.

**0.14.0**

One breaking change: on an edge written with `<-`, `from:` and `to:` now name the sides of the first and second names written. They used to follow the arrow, so `disk <- writer  from: bottom` meant Writer's bottom; it now means Disk's. Swap the two on any `<-` edge that names a side. No other file draws differently.

- A line can have no arrowhead: `edge a -- b`, or `edge a - b`.
- Each end of a line can carry a mark: an arrowhead filled or outlined, a dot, a diamond or a bar, written in the arrow (`a o--> b`, `a diamond--arrow b`) or as `from-mark:` and `to-mark:`, which a style can carry. See "What is drawn at each end".

**0.13.0**

No syntax changes, and no file that worked is refused. Lines move: every line that goes round something, and every line with `below`/`above`/`left of`/`right of` or `between`, may be drawn differently.

- A fix, no syntax change. Lines told which side of a node to pass (`below a`) or which gap to go through (`between a and b`) now find their way as every other line does, so they take lanes and keep their distance from boxes, and two lines through one gap no longer cross where they need not. Several identical `below a` lines used to be drawn on one path, reading as one line with three arrowheads, and a `between` line could run a couple of pixels from a box and come into its target down the target's own edge.
- A curved line that goes round something now sweeps through its turns instead of cornering, as widely as the room allows; a line that steps sideways and carries on is one S. `path: square, corners: rounded` is the way to get the cornered look. Existing diagrams with a line going round a box, a clause or a `between` will look different.
- A line with `below`/`left of` clauses that its direct shape already keeps is drawn direct, as a line without them would be, rather than always with corners. Where it does have to turn, it takes the fewest turns that keep every clause; the old "across first, then down" rule no longer decides. A line told `below m` that would otherwise never reach M's underside is now sent round under M.

**0.12.0**

- Diagrams can be written straight into a web page. Load `dist/element.js` from the package, and each `<reladraw-diagram>` element is drawn in place from the source inside it, with `theme=` choosing the colors. See "In a web page" in the README.

**0.11.1**

- Several diagrams inlined into one web page no longer lose their arrowheads. Every drawing used to name its arrowheads the same way, so a page took them all from the first drawing, and drew none when that drawing was hidden. The gaps where lines cross were named the same way, so a second drawing's lines were cut where the first drawing's crossed. Each drawing's names now carry a prefix of its own, taken from the drawing, so the same source still gives the same SVG.

**0.11.0**

- A line never passes through a box. Every edge takes the shortest way between its ends that goes through none, and goes round whatever is in its way, including edges that name no side. This replaces the separate rules for lines going over a row, turning back and going round a node behind, which kept missing cases; a fan of three from one side into a column was the latest. See "Going round boxes".
- Of two ways round that are equally short, the line goes over the top; otherwise the shorter way wins. It used to go over the top always.
- A curve finishes straight at an arrowhead, so the head points square into its side. Most diagrams with a named side look slightly different.
- Where two lines cross, the later one now breaks for a short gap, as though it passed underneath. It used to draw straight across; `crossing: none` keeps that. See "How the line is drawn".
- Lines that turn down the same gap, such as two into one side of a box, take a lane each in the order that keeps them from crossing, instead of curving across each other.
- A line's text no longer lands on another line's text: where two would overlap, the later one slides along its own line to the nearest clear spot.
- **Breaking:** a line whose named side is flush against another box, with no way out, is refused with the reason. It used to be drawn through the box.

**0.10.0**

- A statement may continue onto the lines after it by indenting them. See "Shape of the file". An error in such a statement names the line the mistake is on.
- **Breaking:** indentation used to be ignored, so an indented `node` line was a statement of its own. It now continues the statement above and is refused, with a message saying to remove the indentation.

**0.9.0**

- Theme colors: `theme-page`, `theme-text`, `theme-muted`, `theme-fill`, `theme-border` and `theme-line` name the theme's own color for each part, and `theme-primary` and `theme-secondary`, with `-subtle` and `theme-on-` forms, name its two accents. Any attribute that takes a color takes them, and they follow the theme when it changes, so a diagram colored with them reads in light and dark themes alike. See "Theme colors".
- A box with a theme fill and no text color of its own gets text that reads on that fill.
- **Breaking:** `muted` is now `theme-muted`. `color: muted` is refused with the new name.
- The examples use theme colors where they used to hand-pick colors for a dark page, so they read in every theme.
- A fourteenth theme, `vesper`, from [Vesper](https://github.com/raunofreiberg/vesper).

**0.8.1**

- A fix, no syntax change. An edge naming a side at both ends could be drawn through one of its own nodes in two cases. With the nodes stacked and the sides at right angles, such as `from: bottom  to: left`, the line went down past the lower node and came back up through it; it is now one curve round the corner. With both ends naming the same side, such as `from: left  to: left`, the line ran straight through the node behind; it now goes over the top of that node, or round the right in a column. Existing diagrams with such an edge will look different, and correct.

- A fix, no syntax change. Children of a container stack close together, and an edge with no text between two of them used to get only that step, so it drew as an arrowhead with no line behind it. The gap now widens to show a short run of line behind each head, as an edge with text already did for its text. Existing diagrams with such an edge will look different, and correct.

**0.8.0**

- `shape: circle`. A circle is sized to hold its text and is always round. Edges on one of its sides spread round that quarter of the circle, and a corner of it is the point on the circle halfway round. It does not yet take a badge, a deck or a node placed against its own edge. Nothing that already renders changes.

**0.7.1**

- A fix, no syntax change. An edge with `line: (path: straight)` and a clause such as `below m` could draw its text on top of `m`. The line now bends through the room left for the text, so the text sits clear of the node. Existing diagrams with such an edge will look different, and correct.

**0.7.0**

- `line:` takes a bracket for everything about how the line is drawn: `path: curved | square | straight`, `corners: sharp | rounded`, `crossing: none | arc | gap | square`, `pattern: solid | dashed | dotted | dash-dot` and `thickness: thin | normal | thick` or a number. `line: red` still works, as the short form of `line: (color: red)`. Every default is how lines were drawn before, so no existing file changes.

**0.6.0**

- An edge whose ends face away from each other, such as `from: left  to: right` with the far node to the right, goes around instead of through its own nodes: through the gap between them if there is room, over the top of the row if not. Several over one row take a lane each. Sides at right angles, such as `from: left  to: top`, go around the same way when one faces away.
- `above`, `below`, `left of` and `right of` on an edge say which side of a node the line passes: `edge a -> b  below c`. Any number, one per node; one naming several nodes covers the stretch between them too. One edge may mix the two kinds, `below m  left of n`, and the line turns between them as often as they need. Clauses that cannot all be drawn are refused with the reason.

**0.5.0**

- Named themes: `diagram theme: nord`, one of thirteen, and `--theme` on the command line to render a file in another without editing it. The playground has a theme picker, which writes the `theme:` line into the source.
- `diagram text: (color: …)` sets every text's color at once.
- `default node | leaf | container | edge` sets what every thing of that kind looks like unless it says otherwise.

**0.4.0**

- A node with any children takes the theme's container colors, however the children are placed. A node with a `badge:` or a single child in a corner now draws as a container too; in 0.3.0 only a node with a title band did. Its text still sits where it did. Say `fill:` and `border:` to keep one looking like a leaf.
- A text's `size` takes a plain number of pixels beside `small`, `normal` and `large`: `(size: 22)`.
- **Breaking:** `deck` is an attribute of the node, not a statement. `deck drive "Drive 2" "Drive 3"` is written `deck: "Drive 2" "Drive 3"` on `node drive`, and the old statement is an error that quotes that line back. It is refused on a picture and on a `shape: none` node, where the statement used to draw nothing.
- **Breaking:** a key written twice on one statement is an error that quotes both values — `fill: red  fill: blue`, `style:` twice, or the same property twice inside one set of brackets. In 0.3.0 one of the two was dropped in silence. A node's own word overriding its style's is unaffected.
- `style:` takes a list, `style: equipment, critical and alarm`, applied in order with a later style winning where two set the same key.
**0.3.0** — the vocabulary, reworked in one breaking version so there is one migration rather than five.

- `box` is `node` and `link` is `edge`. The string on either is its *text*; "label" is not a word the language has.
- A node's **body** is `shape: rectangle | document | none` or `icon: <name>`, and writing both is an error naming both. `note` is gone — a note is `node … shape: none`. `shape: instance` is gone — the icon is `cube`, and a node drawn as one is `icon: cube`.
- A node drawn as a picture and given no text of its own shows none. A node with a body still falls back to its name.
- The decoration icon is `badge:`, which freed `icon:` for the body. It is a shorthand for a child placed beside the text, so a container's badge now sits beside its title rather than in the far corner. It is refused on a picture and on a `shape: none` node, where it used to draw nothing.
- A placement may target a *part* of a node — its text, a side or one of nine named points — with `inside`, `outside` and `on` reading a direction off it.
- Everything a text says about itself is in the brackets after it — `color`, `size`, `wrap`, `align`, `at`. The top-level `size:`, `wrap:`, `align:` and the text color `text:` are gone; a style says them as `text: (…)`. `at:` grew from two positions to the nine.
- `subtext:` is gone, replaced by inline markup `[style]word[/style]`, which names a style and reaches a word anywhere in a text. `\[` escapes a literal bracket.
- `align: widths` is `contents: (widths: match)`, and the same brackets take `align:` for where the block of contents sits.
- `url:` is new: a destination on a node or an edge.
- Attributes and placements may be written in any order after the text.

**0.2.0** — `stroke:` split into the part it colors (`border:`, `line:`, and the text's own color); `width:` became `wrap:`; every attribute is refused by name on a kind that has no use for it, where an unknown one used to be parsed and dropped.

**0.1.0** — first published version.

## Undecided

Open questions the benchmark raised, recorded so a later session does not rediscover them.

- ~~One edge passing some nodes above or below and others left or right — an L-shaped line, across under one node and then down past another — is refused today.~~ Answered in 0.6.0: such an edge turns between the two kinds as few times as it can, and where two orders both fit, a standing rule picks — a side named at an end says which way the line goes first, and with none named it goes across first. Since 0.13.0, such a line takes whichever way keeps its clauses with the fewest turns, and the across-first rule no longer applies. See "Passing on one side of a node" above.
- Named gaps are the first step toward numbers, but making them minimums took most of the pressure off: they now set how much a diagram breathes, never whether something fits. Whether four names is the right number is still open.
- Four machines each holding a `files` child with the same text means writing the same line four times. This is the strongest case for a set-level declaration, for terseness rather than for placement.
- The 2×2 arrangement around a hub is four independent statements, so a fifth machine has no slot to reflow into. There are only eight directions.
- ~~Two annotations anchored to the same side of one node will collide.~~ Answered by putting both in an invisible container and placing the container, so they stack instead of stacking on top of each other. Writing it the colliding way is now an error rather than a bad picture, since nothing in the file orders the two. Whether the container idiom is good enough or wants dedicated syntax is open.
- Nothing yet expresses one node spanning several rows of a parallel column, which the OSI reference render needs.
- ~~How contents sit inside a container that is wider than they are.~~ Answered by `contents: (widths: …, align: …)` — see "How the contents sit". Automatic centering stays ruled out: it would move every existing diagram whose container title is wider than its contents. Whether this is the same question as the bracketed node sitting against one side of its slack, under "Known to be wrong", is still open — they share the phrase and not the mechanism, since one distributes to a group at size time and the other is a single member in a constraint system.
