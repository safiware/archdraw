Usage: ./dev.sh <command> [args]

Node is all most of this needs. `look` and `screenshot` also want headless
Chrome, and the image-reading commands at the bottom want ImageMagick.

Commands:
  install                       Install the dev dependencies (npm install).
                                 Needed once per machine before `build`.
  build                         Compile TypeScript: the library, then the browser element
  clean-build                   rm -rf dist and examples/out, then compile
  render <file> <out.svg>       Run the compiled CLI on a .reladraw file
  try '<statements>'            Parse and render source given on the command
                                 line, printing whatever the tool says about it.
                                 For checking one statement, and especially for
                                 reading an error message back in full.
  out <file>                    Render to examples/out/<basename>.svg and .png,
                                 both regenerated together so the PNG can never
                                 go stale against its SVG. The name comes from
                                 the source, so one .reladraw has exactly one pair
                                 and there is never a question which to open.
  themes <file>                 Render one file in every theme, into
                                 examples/out/themes/<basename>-<theme>.png,
                                 plus <basename>-all.png: every theme side by
                                 side and labelled, for judging the palettes
                                 against each other. Wants ImageMagick.
  look <file> [out.png]         Render, then screenshot at the SVG's own size.
                                 This is the one to use when you want to see a
                                 diagram; it needs no dimensions from you.
                                 out.png defaults to a temp file, path printed.
  readme-image                  Regenerate the README's tracked pictures:
                                 docs/arch-render.png, the rendered half of the
                                 comparison, and docs/gap.png
  playground                    Regenerate docs/index.html, the browser
                                 playground, with the compiled library inlined
                                 into the page. Edit tools/playground.html, not
                                 docs/index.html. Re-run after any source
                                 change, or the hosted page demonstrates an
                                 older version of the language.
  open                          Regenerate docs/index.html and open it in the
                                 default browser. The page is self-contained,
                                 so it needs no server.
  pack                          Build, pack exactly what `npm publish` would
                                 ship, install that tarball into a throwaway
                                 directory and render a diagram with it. The
                                 stranger's-first-command check, run before
                                 every release.
  check-version <version>       Refuse unless README.md, SYNTAX.md's title and
                                 changelog, and the skill's copy of SYNTAX.md
                                 all say <version>. Run by `npm version` as the
                                 preversion script, so a release whose docs
                                 name the old number stops before anything is
                                 bumped, committed or tagged.
  skill                         Refresh the copy of SYNTAX.md that the agent
                                 skill in .claude/skills/reladraw/ carries as
                                 its reference. Re-run after editing SYNTAX.md,
                                 or the skill teaches an older language than
                                 the tool accepts.
  llms                          Regenerate docs/llms-full.txt, the skill's guide
                                 and SYNTAX.md joined into one page for a
                                 language model to read at one URL. Re-run after
                                 editing either. docs/llms.txt, the short index
                                 that points at it, is written by hand.
  snippets [file.md ...]        Parse every reladraw snippet in the hand-written
                                 docs and name the ones the parser now refuses.
                                 Defaults to README.md, SYNTAX.md, CONTRIBUTING.md,
                                 the skill and docs/llms.txt.
  stale                         Rebuild every generated copy into a scratch
                                 directory and name each committed one that
                                 differs — the skill's syntax, llms-full.txt, the
                                 playground, the README pictures — then check the
                                 version numbers and snippets, and end with the
                                 questions only a reader can answer. Run before
                                 committing a change to the language or the
                                 examples; the local pre-commit hook runs it too.
  page [out.png] [WxH] [fragment]
                                 Screenshot the built playground page. `page dom
                                 [fragment]` prints the DOM after its scripts
                                 have run, which is how you check the page
                                 assembled itself without opening a browser.
                                 The optional fragment is a shared link's
                                 base64url source — the way to load a long file
                                 into the editor without clicking. Run
                                 `playground` first — this looks at what is on
                                 disk, not at the template.
  page-run '<js>' [out.png] [WxH]
                                 Screenshot a copy of the playground that runs
                                 <js> once its own scripts have. A headless
                                 browser cannot click or drag, so this is how an
                                 interaction is checked: the script does it with
                                 .click() or a dispatched event. docs/ is
                                 untouched. Chrome will not lay a window out
                                 much narrower than 500 pixels, so a narrower
                                 WxH is cropped rather than reflowed.
  page-examples [out.png] [WxH] [n]
                                 page-run with the Examples picker open and the
                                 nth example (default 1, counting from 0)
                                 previewed.
  element [out.png] [WxH]       Screenshot tools/element.html, the check page
                                 for <reladraw-diagram>: each case on it says
                                 what should appear. `element dom` prints the
                                 DOM after the element has drawn. Run `build`
                                 first — it loads dist/element.js.
  before <file> [ref]           Render one example as <ref> renders it, into
                                 examples/out/<name>-before.png. `regress` says
                                 that something moved; this is how you see what.
  pictures [ref]                Which pictures did this change move? The check to
                                 run after changing the code or an example file.
                                 Renders every example as <ref> (default HEAD)
                                 has it, its own sources with its own build, and
                                 as the working tree has it, and lists the ones
                                 that differ. Anything listed that the change
                                 was not meant to touch is a regression. It
                                 compares SVG bytes, so a `url:` shows as moved
                                 with no visible change; compare the PNGs.
  regress [ref]                 Like `pictures`, but renders the working tree's
                                 example files with both builds, to isolate a
                                 code change. Only for when no example file
                                 changed: an edited example shows as moved.
  snapshot <dir>                Render every example with the working tree into
                                 <dir>, as a baseline for `against`. For a long
                                 change built in steps on top of uncommitted
                                 work, where HEAD is not the baseline you mean.
  against <dir>                 Render every example with the working tree and
                                 say which differ from the SVGs `snapshot` put
                                 in <dir>.
  stress [full]                 Is routing lines still fast? Times the library on
                                 made-up diagrams of 45 boxes and 5, 10 and 20
                                 lines, stopping at the first over its limit, in
                                 a few seconds. `full` goes on to 30 and 48 lines.
                                 Run after changing how lines are routed; it
                                 builds first. Each run adds a row to
                                 stress-history.tsv (untracked): when, commit
                                 (+ for uncommitted changes), machine, times.
  clicks <file.svg> <x> <y> ... What a browser would follow at each point, or
                                 "nothing". A `url:` is the one thing in the
                                 output a picture cannot show, and the obvious
                                 way to nest one link inside another is dropped
                                 silently by Chrome, so it is checked here.
  nodes <file>                  Print the solved geometry of every node
  overlaps <file>               List node pairs that share space (exit 1 if any)
  tokens <file>                 Print how the syntax scanner classifies each
  blocks <file.md ...>          Parse every fenced diagram in a Markdown file
                                 and report the ones the language will not
                                 accept. SYNTAX.md, README.md and the skill are
                                 the files this is for.
                                 line, and check the spans cover it exactly.
                                 The playground draws its coloring behind a
                                 transparent textarea, so a dropped character
                                 slides the whole line out of register.
  screenshot <in.svg> <out.png> [WxH] [bg]
                                 Headless Chrome screenshot of an SVG. Prefer
                                 `look` unless you need a specific size.
                                 WxH defaults to 1600x1200. bg takes a hex
                                 RGB/RGBA with no leading '#', or the words
                                 white / black / transparent.

Reading colors out of a reference image (all take any PNG):
  imgdiff <a.png> <b.png> [out] How many pixels differ between two images, and
                                 each one's size. With out, also writes a picture
                                 of the difference there. For telling whether a
                                 PNG that is not byte-identical actually moved.
  sidebyside <a> <b> <out.png>  Put two pictures next to each other, each trimmed
                                 to its drawing, a strip between. Either may be an
                                 SVG, which is screenshotted first. For judging
                                 a MOVED example: the snapshot's SVG against the
                                 new render.
  pixel <img> <x> <y>           Hex color of one pixel
  palette <img> [WxH+X+Y] [n]   The n most common colors in a region, biggest
                                 first. Region defaults to the whole image,
                                 n to 12.
  scan <img> <y> [x0] [w]       Walk left to right along row <y> and print each
                                 x where the color changes. This is how you
                                 find a border: the fill runs flat for a long
                                 stretch and the edge shows up as a one- or
                                 two-pixel spike. x0 defaults to 0, w to 900.
  crop <img> <WxH+X+Y> [out]    Cut a region out to its own PNG and print the
                                 path, optionally magnified with a trailing
                                 xN (crop img 300x200+100+50 out.png x3). This
                                 is how you look closely at one part of a
                                 render or a reference without squinting at
                                 the whole drawing scaled down.
  textrows <img> <WxH+X+Y>      Ink rows in a region, as ranges. Each run of
                                 consecutive rows carrying a non-background
                                 pixel is one line of text, so the heights give
                                 glyph size and the spacings give baseline to
                                 baseline. This is how a text size is read off
                                 a reference instead of guessed.
