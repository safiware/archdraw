/**
 * The language's *lexical* vocabulary, and a scanner that classifies one line of
 * source into colored spans.
 *
 * This is deliberately separate from `parser.ts`, and it is not a second parser.
 * The parser answers "what does this file mean" and refuses anything it cannot
 * answer for; a highlighter has to color a half-typed line without complaint,
 * so it answers only "what kind of word is this" and never fails. Every rule
 * below is a regex applied to a single line, in priority order, with one bit of
 * carried state (whether anything has been seen on the line yet, and whether the
 * previous token was an attribute key).
 *
 * **That restriction is the point, and it is what makes this reusable.** An
 * Emacs `font-lock-keywords` list, a Vim `syntax match` file and a TextMate
 * grammar are all exactly this: an ordered list of single-line regexes with a
 * face attached. So the vocabulary here — which is the half that goes stale, and
 * which is imported from `ast.ts`, `constants.ts` and `icons.ts` rather than
 * retyped — can be emitted into any of those without this file being ported.
 * The scanner is the JavaScript consumer of the same spec, and the playground is
 * its only caller.
 *
 * No token spans lines: `//` runs to the end of one, a string closes on one,
 * and there are no blocks. A statement may continue onto indented lines, but
 * each of those is colored by the same rules, and a word that is a keyword at
 * the start of one is refused by the parser anyway. That is the property those
 * editor formats need and the reason a `.reladraw` grammar is small in all of
 * them.
