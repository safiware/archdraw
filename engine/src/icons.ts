 * not have the font, and an `<image href>` would need the file to travel beside
 * the SVG. Inline paths cost a few hundred bytes each and always arrive.
 *
 * A name here says what the thing *is*, never what the picture looks like. The

 * the word is the whole interface, so it has to carry meaning rather than
 * geometry, and naming the meaning is what lets the drawing be improved later
 * without every diagram that uses it changing sense.
 *
 * The set is deliberately small. In a drawing tool you pick a shape out of a
 * visual palette and hundreds are browsable; here you type the word from memory,
 * which caps the useful vocabulary at something that fits in a head. Add a name
 * when a diagram asks for a distinction it cannot otherwise make.
