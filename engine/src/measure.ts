 * no text could contain one, so `TCP/IP` came out as two lines, and so did
 * `16/9`, `I/O` and every path or URL. Requiring the spaces keeps the marker
 * legible where it is meant — `"Computer 1 / Ubuntu"` — while a
 * slash inside a word stays an ordinary character.
 *
 * That leaves the text that wants a spaced slash and no break — `Before / After`
 * — which writes it `\/`. The lexer preserves that escape rather than resolving
 * it, so the backslash is still here to suppress the split, and is dropped once
 * the splitting is done.
