 * copy a reference lands on draws the same thing — unless that copy is hidden,

 * drops it, leaving a PNG unharmed. Plain `href` and not `xlink:href`: the
 * SVG 1.1 spelling would need an `xmlns:xlink` on every drawing whether or not
 * anything in it links anywhere, and every current browser takes the SVG 2 one.
 *
 * `target="_blank"` always, because the playground inlines the SVG into its own
 * page and a click inside it would otherwise navigate the playground away;
 * `rel="noopener"` goes with it as it does anywhere else.
 *
 * **An `<a>` is never nested inside another.** Nesting is the obvious way to let
 * a container carry a destination while a child carries its own, and it does not
 * work: Chrome draws nothing at all inside the inner one, so the child simply
 * disappears from the picture. Every node's anchor therefore wraps only what
 * that node draws — outline and text — and its children are emitted beside
 * it, each wrapping itself. The reading comes out the same anyway, because the
 * container's filled outline lies under the children and catches every click
 * that does not land on one of them.
 *
 * A destination therefore reaches down the tree instead of enclosing it: a child
 * that names none of its own is drawn inside an anchor carrying its container's,
 * and one that names its own overrules it. That is the reading nesting would
 * have given — the container catches every click its children do not — reached
 * by repeating the destination rather than by wrapping.
