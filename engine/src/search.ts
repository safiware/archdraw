/**
 * Finding a line's way through the open space between boxes.
 *
 * Every box is a wall. A line may turn only where two tracks cross, and the
 * tracks are few: a line a little way out from each side of each wall, one
 * down the middle of each gap between walls, and the lines through the two
 * ends. That is the whole of the open space a right-angled line ever needs,
 * reduced to a grid of a few hundred points for a diagram of ordinary size.
 *
 * The line leaves its start heading straight out and arrives at its end heading
 * straight in, with a straight stretch at each end at least `stub` long, so an
 * arrowhead always lands on a straight piece. Between those two stretches it
 * takes the cheapest way through the grid, where cost is length plus a charge
 * for every turn and for every line already placed that it crosses. On a
 * right-angled grid many ways tie on length — a staircase is exactly as long as
 * one bend — and the turn charge breaks those ties toward the fewest bends,
 * which is the line a person would draw. What still ties after that goes over
 * the top rather than under, and round the right rather than the left.
 *
 * A way through a box is not a losing option here. It is not a way at all.
