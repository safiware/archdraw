/**
 * Parse every fenced code block in a Markdown file and say which ones the
 * language does not accept.
 *
 * Every code block in `SYNTAX.md`, `README.md` and `SKILL.md` is supposed to be
 * a file this tool can read, and a reference teaching syntax that no longer
 * parses is worse than no reference. The check had never had a command, so it
 * was done by hand after a vocabulary change, or not at all.
 *
 * Not every block is a diagram — a shell snippet and a deliberate error example
 * are both legitimate — so this reports rather than judges, and the caller
 * decides. A block whose first line is not a statement keyword is skipped
 * outright, which is what keeps shell out of the report.
