// Builds docs/index.html: the playground page with the compiled library inlined.
//
// ES modules do not load over file://, so a page that imports dist/ is neither
// double-clickable nor hostable without a server. Inlining the JavaScript into
// one <script> is what makes the page both, and it is the only reason this
// script exists. Run it through `./dev.sh playground`.
//
// The inlining is a flat concatenation, not a bundler. tsc emits one shape of
// module here — static single-line imports at the top, `export` on top-level
// declarations, no defaults, no cycles — so dropping the import lines and the
// `export` keywords and joining the files in dependency order gives one scope
// that behaves identically. The one thing that would break it silently is two
// modules declaring the same top-level name, so that is checked and refused.
